      "and this is because the photos are now\n",
      "not going to be able to do this and\n",
      "listen to that so that off um so there's\n",
      "a lot of black bars some images are\n",
      "bigger than others I say most of these\n",
      "would be full size at around\n",
      "35% so if we go into our effect\n",
      "controls let's have a look B to get back\n",
      "to the arrow effect control so we're at\n",
      "27 that means they've scaled all the way\n",
      "down to 27 to be able to fit in the\n",
      "frame I wonder if I make this about 35\n",
      "that fits love that so um so these\n",
      "photos are basically bigger than the\n",
      "sequence I have\n",
      "set actually before we go I might show\n",
      "you how to set the sequence so we're\n",
      "just going to click command and c and\n",
      "then I'm going to Marky select it's\n",
      "easier and lazier um everything so it's\n",
      "in little white boxes and it's selected\n",
      "right click go to paste attributes and\n",
      "make sure it's just on motion and click\n",
      "okay and see if that resolves most of\n",
      "the clips okay some are still too\n",
      "small but definitely an\n",
      "improvement okay so this one seems to be\n",
      "one of the smallest I'm just going to go\n",
      "in here I think around 60% okay great so\n",
      "and you can just click your arrow keys\n",
      "back and forth just to fix it up to\n",
      "however you want it to be some of them\n",
      "are going to be a bit too big some this\n",
      "one's one of the smallest ones for\n",
      "sure small this is fine fraction no\n",
      "actually was fine turns\n",
      "out no fraction there we go um yeah some\n",
      "of these are just a bit smaller than I'd\n",
      "like it to be it's not going to lose the\n",
      "impact but this is a really fun way to\n",
      "Showcase your\n",
      "Photography in a video format which we\n",
      "all know is where the mo the like world\n",
      "has just shifted to which is Wild is\n",
      "this one too big no that was perfect\n",
      "size uh great great great can zoom in a\n",
      "bit great oh bit small\n",
      "great you can just kind of do this to\n",
      "your heart content maybe you want\n",
      "sometimes a black bar and you could have\n",
      "a really fun background in it I think\n",
      "that's a fraction small it was um and\n",
      "you can really play with your layers\n",
      "make it as interesting you want maybe\n",
      "you want them all to be this size maybe\n",
      "you want that um and then it's just\n",
      "playing with it\n",
      "till you know you\n",
      "decided that's how it should look so\n",
      "we're just going through as quick as we\n",
      "can camels oh you know what bring this\n",
      "one a bit bigger\n",
      "camels we're doing this quite quick\n",
      "we're already a second and she says oh\n",

      "this this is personally how I like to do\n",
      "it CU I want to make sure every shot is\n",
      "okay um the way to make sure I guess\n",
      "when you're editing yourself it's all\n",
      "going to be perfect is to make sure your\n",
      "photos are already the right you know\n",
      "format they're already 9 by 16 when you\n",
      "drag them in oh didn't mean to make that\n",
      "smaller that's fine that's we're back on\n",
      "the camels there's like just a couple\n",
      "here that are a fraction too\n",
      "small I mean you can also do this in a\n",
      "way where you like want to flip them the\n",
      "other way make it look a bit different\n",

      "00:08:44.000 on your clips and you need to select them in order for this to work in the way that you want it to um another quick way is we can just select all of them right now and that's probably what I'm going to do in a very particular way in no way at all so um they will appear in the order they are selected that's just \n",
      "\n",
      "00:09:00.000 no way at all so um they will appear in the order they are selected that's just how automate sequence works so we'll give it a shot selecting and then we will have a go right so let's go back into premere yeah there we go um I think this is all of them brilliant yeah it's all 50 items I can see that here 50 \n",
      "\n",
      "00:09:16.000 this is all of them brilliant yeah it's all 50 items I can see that here 50 items so what you want to do is Select them in order of how you want them so if you wanted them like this you just select them like this and this is the order that going to appear as you collect them so maybe we want this green \n",

      "00:09:28.000 order that going to appear as you collect them so maybe we want this green with more green and rocks and then we go into I don't know what looks good with that this kind of thing then Into the Blue Water back to Blue back to Blue um let's get more you know green in it and then back to green uh green green with \n",
      "\n",
      "00:09:43.000 let's get more you know green in it and then back to green uh green green with water again uh green with water mountaintops uh let's get all these Tanny mountain tops um and then we need to get into blue somehow I guess so we'll go through all \n",
      "\n",
      "00:10:00.000 and then we need to get into blue somehow I guess so we'll go through all of these Into the Blue here we go teal blue this one this one this one and then we need to start getting into there we go pink and that is selecting all of them I'm just going to make this smaller \n",

      "00:10:18.000 go pink and that is selecting all of them I'm just going to make this smaller again if you wondering how I'm making this screen bigger and smaller I'm using the tilter key um it's on my British keyboard it's above the control and options but um I don't it might be different for you it looks like a little \n",
