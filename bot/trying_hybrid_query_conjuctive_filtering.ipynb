      "Id: 81, Start: 00:21:24.000, Overview: Youtube as well but I will say if it is a short you cannot upload a thumbnail so there is that my preferred way is using the media file settings I'll always opt for a h264 cuz most social media platforms do currently prefer that but we are moving to h265 that's a whole other thing and ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4\n",
      "Id: 82, Start: 00:21:39.000, Overview: currently prefer that but we are moving to h265 that's a whole other thing and then I just go adaptive High bit rate I look at my video I click more I always render out maximum depth I use maximum render quality and then I go down to our B bit rate settings this is really important ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4\n",
      "Id: 83, Start: 00:21:53.000, Overview: quality and then I go down to our B bit rate settings this is really important so I really quickly want to touch on bit rate settings I'm going to have to read them off my screen if it if if it was a YouTube video that is a 4K video you want a bit rate of between 35 and 45 megabits per second if it's 1080 video ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4\n",

      "Id: 85, Start: 00:22:29.000, Overview: it prefers 1080 export not 4K if you export it and upload it 4K it might look worse cuz it's going to recompress that worse so export 1080 it prefers 30 frames a second and again around the same kind of bit rate um I think you could go as low as eight which is insane but we're just going to go for 15 and ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4\n",

      "Id: 111, Start: 00:02:38.000, Overview: process is obviously having your design in this case I have this little apple here uh you can also use pngs things that are fully uh I guess traced out or imported in make sure they have a transparent background you want it to be you know as uh I guess shaped as possible so you don't have to worry ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s\n",

      "Id: 113, Start: 00:03:11.000, Overview: using this vectored design that I did uh really what we're going to be doing is we're going to be adding some effects in order to make this illustration really pop and make it kind of come across like a sticker there's a few techniques that you can use it's pretty simple uh and there's some really fun use applications ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s\n",
      "Id: 114, Start: 00:03:29.000, Overview: you can use it's pretty simple uh and there's some really fun use applications for that so typically the first thing I like to do is make sure that my image illustrator illustration I should say is grouped up what I'm going to do as well just so we can see two examples is I'm just going ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s\n",
      "Id: 115, Start: 00:03:45.000, Overview: just so we can see two examples is I'm just going to roster this image to make sure it's all on the same layer and this is kind of what we want to avoid right we want to avoid this white kind of shape around and if you're importing a PNG or if you have some art ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s\n",
      "Id: 116, Start: 00:03:59.000, Overview: white kind of shape around and if you're importing a PNG or if you have some art that you maybe are reusing on a background the easiest way to get rid of this white box around your character is by going up to object image Trace make an expand and we'll have a ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s\n",
      "Id: 117, Start: 00:04:16.000, Overview: an expand and we'll have a little panel like this that will show up and what we can do is we can just click okay and then it will expand those objects if you go over to the direct selection tool you can click on this background and you can delete it there ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s\n",

      "Id: 120, Start: 00:05:06.000, Overview: around here there we go go to window transform and just make sure your scale corners and scale strokes and effects are turned on just because if you are going to be using this for promo you want to make sure that your stroke sizes accordingly instead of having this weird like thin ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s\n",

      "Id: 125, Start: 00:06:22.000, Overview: to do is Click command C and command V and you'll see that I copied my character over here and you can drag it over top and try to get it all centered up you could use the Align tool to get these all centered up but even over that my favorite method which is not what I did initially is just click shift ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s\n",
      "Id: 126, Start: 00:06:37.000, Overview: my favorite method which is not what I did initially is just click shift command V and it'll paste right on top of that image so you don't have to worry about it being unaligned now what I like to do is I like to name or label my uh designs or my ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s\n",

      "Id: 130, Start: 00:07:37.000, Overview: what I can do is just click on the weight up arrow and add a bit of a stroke to this image you'll probably immediately notice something with this design and with this stroke effect and that is that it is creating the stroke on the inside and that's something that we can't really change when we're ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s\n",
