      "Id: 81, Start: 00:21:24.000, Overview: Youtube as well but I will say if it is a short you cannot upload a thumbnail so there is that my preferred way is using the media file settings I'll always opt for a h264 cuz most social media platforms do currently prefer that but we are moving to h265 that's a whole other thing and ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4\n",

      "Id: 85, Start: 00:22:29.000, Overview: it prefers 1080 export not 4K if you export it and upload it 4K it might look worse cuz it's going to recompress that worse so export 1080 it prefers 30 frames a second and again around the same kind of bit rate um I think you could go as low as eight which is insane but we're just going to go for 15 and ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4\n",

      "Id: 111, Start: 00:02:38.000, Overview: process is obviously having your design in this case I have this little apple here uh you can also use pngs things that are fully uh I guess traced out or imported in make sure they have a transparent background you want it to be you know as uh I guess shaped as possible so you don't have to worry ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s\n",
      "Id: 112, Start: 00:02:56.000, Overview: you know as uh I guess shaped as possible so you don't have to worry about having things clip because we're going to be working in outlines today uh but really anything can work in this case for this case use we're going to be using this vectored design that I did uh really what we're going to be doing is ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s\n",
      "Id: 113, Start: 00:03:11.000, Overview: using this vectored design that I did uh really what we're going to be doing is we're going to be adding some effects in order to make this illustration really pop and make it kind of come across like a sticker there's a few techniques that you can use it's pretty simple uh and there's some really fun use applications ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s\n",
      "Id: 114, Start: 00:03:29.000, Overview: you can use it's pretty simple uh and there's some really fun use applications for that so typically the first thing I like to do is make sure that my image illustrator illustration I should say is grouped up what I'm going to do as well just so we can see two examples is I'm just going ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s\n",

      "Id: 120, Start: 00:05:06.000, Overview: around here there we go go to window transform and just make sure your scale corners and scale strokes and effects are turned on just because if you are going to be using this for promo you want to make sure that your stroke sizes accordingly instead of having this weird like thin ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s\n",

      "Id: 125, Start: 00:06:22.000, Overview: to do is Click command C and command V and you'll see that I copied my character over here and you can drag it over top and try to get it all centered up you could use the Align tool to get these all centered up but even over that my favorite method which is not what I did initially is just click shift ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s\n",
