      "Id: 00:02:08.000, Start: 00:02:08.000, Overview: and uh let's learn some stuff so over here in illustrator you'll see I have a little character that I've drawn uh today is going to be all about creating stickers sticker mockups uh pretty much just having assets either for your thumbnails for uh Instagram or for YouTube or even if you just want to you ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s\n",
      "Id: 00:02:24.000, Start: 00:02:24.000, Overview: thumbnails for uh Instagram or for YouTube or even if you just want to you know mock something up to see if someone's interested in having some stickers from you this is what this is for so the best place to start with this process is obviously having your design in this case I have this little apple ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s\n",
      "Id: 00:02:38.000, Start: 00:02:38.000, Overview: process is obviously having your design in this case I have this little apple here uh you can also use pngs things that are fully uh I guess traced out or imported in make sure they have a transparent background you want it to be you know as uh I guess shaped as possible so you don't have to worry ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s\n",
      "Id: 00:02:56.000, Start: 00:02:56.000, Overview: you know as uh I guess shaped as possible so you don't have to worry about having things clip because we're going to be working in outlines today uh but really anything can work in this case for this case use we're going to be using this vectored design that I did uh really what we're going to be doing is ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s\n",
      "Id: 00:03:11.000, Start: 00:03:11.000, Overview: using this vectored design that I did uh really what we're going to be doing is we're going to be adding some effects in order to make this illustration really pop and make it kind of come across like a sticker there's a few techniques that you can use it's pretty simple uh and there's some really fun use applications ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s\n",
      "Id: 00:03:29.000, Start: 00:03:29.000, Overview: you can use it's pretty simple uh and there's some really fun use applications for that so typically the first thing I like to do is make sure that my image illustrator illustration I should say is grouped up what I'm going to do as well just so we can see two examples is I'm just going ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s\n",
      "Id: 00:03:45.000, Start: 00:03:45.000, Overview: just so we can see two examples is I'm just going to roster this image to make sure it's all on the same layer and this is kind of what we want to avoid right we want to avoid this white kind of shape around and if you're importing a PNG or if you have some art ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s\n",
      "Id: 00:03:59.000, Start: 00:03:59.000, Overview: white kind of shape around and if you're importing a PNG or if you have some art that you maybe are reusing on a background the easiest way to get rid of this white box around your character is by going up to object image Trace make an expand and we'll have a ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s\n",
      "Id: 00:04:16.000, Start: 00:04:16.000, Overview: an expand and we'll have a little panel like this that will show up and what we can do is we can just click okay and then it will expand those objects if you go over to the direct selection tool you can click on this background and you can delete it there ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s\n",
      "Id: 00:04:33.000, Start: 00:04:33.000, Overview: selection tool you can click on this background and you can delete it there you go now you have a flat image that you can use for this process if you are like me and you're working in your vectored work and you want to keep the outlines uh I should say if you want to keep your PIN tool connected to where ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s\n",
      "Id: 00:04:51.000, Start: 00:04:51.000, Overview: outlines uh I should say if you want to keep your PIN tool connected to where you can resize this however you want just make sure when you do go to your let's see edit I believe I'm looking for the transform tool somewhere around here there we go go to window transform ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s\n",
      "Id: 00:05:06.000, Start: 00:05:06.000, Overview: around here there we go go to window transform and just make sure your scale corners and scale strokes and effects are turned on just because if you are going to be using this for promo you want to make sure that your stroke sizes accordingly instead of having this weird like thin ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s\n",
      "Id: 00:05:23.000, Start: 00:05:23.000, Overview: sure that your stroke sizes accordingly instead of having this weird like thin shaped character it's never fun just a little tip you know just for some practical use so first step if you want to add that outline around your character this is my favorite way to do it uh there are easier ways to do it of ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s\n",
      "Id: 00:05:40.000, Start: 00:05:40.000, Overview: character this is my favorite way to do it uh there are easier ways to do it of course but I find this to be the fastest all you want to do what I'm going to do actually even before we get started with that is I'm just going to make a background color on our artboard just so you can see that differentiation of the ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s\n",
      "Id: 00:05:54.000, Start: 00:05:54.000, Overview: background color on our artboard just so you can see that differentiation of the character and the stroke all I'm doing here is going over to the uh rectangle option choosing the color of the background or I should say the the outside of the artboard making it the shape of the artboard and I'm just going ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s\n",
      "Id: 00:06:08.000, Start: 00:06:08.000, Overview: outside of the artboard making it the shape of the artboard and I'm just going to bring it all the way down to the bottom so we can see our characters and lock that image so what you can do is click on your character and all you need to do is Click command C and command V and you'll see that I copied my ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s\n",
      "Id: 00:06:22.000, Start: 00:06:22.000, Overview: to do is Click command C and command V and you'll see that I copied my character over here and you can drag it over top and try to get it all centered up you could use the Align tool to get these all centered up but even over that my favorite method which is not what I did initially is just click shift ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s\n",
      "Id: 00:06:37.000, Start: 00:06:37.000, Overview: my favorite method which is not what I did initially is just click shift command V and it'll paste right on top of that image so you don't have to worry about it being unaligned now what I like to do is I like to name or label my uh designs or my ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s\n",

      "Id: 00:07:06.000, Start: 00:07:06.000, Overview: stroke now that I have my art and my stroke layer labeled what I can do is I can go ahead and turn off the view of my art you'll probably notice that there isn't much of a difference but what you can do now is click on your stroke uh stroke layer I should say go to the stroke panel if you don't see the stroke ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s\n",
      "Id: 00:07:23.000, Start: 00:07:23.000, Overview: stroke layer I should say go to the stroke panel if you don't see the stroke panel you can just go over to window stroke and that'll bring up the stroke panel and what I want to do is I want to create a stroke around this image so what I can do is just click on the weight up arrow and add a bit of a ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s\n",
      "Id: 00:07:37.000, Start: 00:07:37.000, Overview: what I can do is just click on the weight up arrow and add a bit of a stroke to this image you'll probably immediately notice something with this design and with this stroke effect and that is that it is creating the stroke on the inside and that's something that we can't really change when we're ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s\n",

      "Id: 00:08:05.000, Start: 00:08:05.000, Overview: white you'll see we'll kind of have this like filled out shape kind of look and when we turn on our art it gives us this nice outline around it you can adjust that stroke layer as much or as little as you want so say let's zoom in a little bit here we want to turn this down and have a bit of a ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s\n",

      "Id: 00:08:34.000, Start: 00:08:34.000, Overview: because it's a bit of a nicer Vibe and it feels like you're just peeling the sticker right off so what you can do after you are happy with your stroke size is you can just go ahead and highlight your whole image click command G and over here you'll see It'll group that and we'll name this ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s\n",
      "Id: 00:08:47.000, Start: 00:08:47.000, Overview: G and over here you'll see It'll group that and we'll name this apple sticker one perfect so we've got a general idea down of how to make our stroke around our image but what if we have a vector shape what if we have something that isn't a PNG well it's actually pretty simple and it's going to ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s\n",

      "Id: 00:10:03.000, Start: 00:10:03.000, Overview: here we can just go to our stroke panel go ahead and make the stroke about 90 because that's what we liked you'll notice with this specific character because it isn't image traced and because there are still some outlines that are being preserved in this image uh you'll see some little spikes that's ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s\n",
      "Id: 00:10:18.000, Start: 00:10:18.000, Overview: that are being preserved in this image uh you'll see some little spikes that's just because with these Corners uh automatically you're going to have these miter joints Co I guess is what you're called like the butt Caps or the what I essentially what I'm trying to say is the flat sharp edges if you want to ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s\n",

      "Id: 00:24:24.000, Start: 00:24:24.000, Overview: maybe we should do something like that so have your object selected here go to object go to repeat and go to grid I think you can Al you can also do pattern if you wanted to make a pattern for like adding it to your packaging or something but I think I just want to experiment with how this is going to look like ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkPDg7RZa4\n",

      "Id: 00:24:48.000, Start: 00:24:48.000, Overview: grid that looks awesome I think this is a great start of like seeing how it would look on packaging design or maybe even like a box and um I think the key thing about patterns is knowing that it's a pattern but it's still not a pattern you know what I mean like right now you can see variations and like see ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkPDg7RZa4\n",
      "Id: 00:25:03.000, Start: 00:25:03.000, Overview: pattern you know what I mean like right now you can see variations and like see where the things are repeating like this ways is like super evident but the good thing about repeat grids is that you have repeat options this is where you can change the spacing the grid type flip rows or flip columns let's go ahead ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYkPDg7RZa4\n",

      "Id: 00:03:37.000, Start: 00:03:37.000, Overview: the style in which I think it's going to be best for me to start building this collage so I have some portraits here that I've chosen and I've chosen them specifically into different scales and I've already turned them black and white you can do that by going into image adjustment black and white which ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2k1pHKSHtg\n",
      "Id: 00:03:52.000, Start: 00:03:52.000, Overview: you can do that by going into image adjustment black and white which also has a shortcut by the way or shift command you if you don't worry about what kind of black and white there's very many variations so now I have two different images that are going to be more or less my hero images right you ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2k1pHKSHtg\n",

      "Id: 00:04:24.000, Start: 00:04:24.000, Overview: have my contextual bar here and what I love about it is that it understands that these are some some of the steps that I may take next because I'm sitting on a rized file which could be maybe I want to select the subject maybe I want to remove a background and in fact it's right I want to remove the background of ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2k1pHKSHtg\n",

      "Id: 00:05:59.000, Start: 00:05:59.000, Overview: okay about this is this process is that you're able to always access that mask so I can bring back some of the detail or information without having to worry that I'm going to lose all that information once it removed my background it removes the background but it kind of stores it safely away right ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2k1pHKSHtg\n",
