13,00:03:37.000,fine there's fine you can play with these it's always super fun we won't need frame we're good right so this is the sequence that I'm working with this week you might recognize it from last week let's give it a zoom in it is good old MADD Mo let's watch this through in the ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
14,00:03:50.000,let's give it a zoom in it is good old MADD Mo let's watch this through in the current format uh you know what let me rejig it so that this screen just a bit bigger for you guys cuz you know I I get it I'm mini but you know she's the star it's her world we're all just living in ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
15,00:04:05.000,but you know she's the star it's her world we're all just living in it that's not true she's amazing uh so anyway yeah there we go ready for someone's eag pain brush every 10 days beep [Music] ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
16,00:04:27.000,days beep [Music] up we just got it the Beeper roll no PL paint so I think we should do two shots ruin oh I'm so sorry oh there we go Loops yep that's Maddie uh wholesome content she commissioned we basically had realized ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
17,00:04:55.000,Maddie uh wholesome content she commissioned we basically had realized there were so many of these beeps we had to make a bleep of real we just like had to so this was like as much as this looks really good in uh 169 which is a horizontal a horizontal view even it's just not vertical video friendly is it ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
18,00:05:11.000,horizontal a horizontal view even it's just not vertical video friendly is it now like we know that that's where these kind of things Thrive it's on Instagram reals shorts for Maddie particularly because she is in YouTube kids so that's the other reason it's like only 30 seconds long and then uh Tik Tok like ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
19,00:05:27.000,the other reason it's like only 30 seconds long and then uh Tik Tok like that's where all these fun little bits extras tend to do better because short videos like this that are under a minute are not considered YouTube videos they're shorts on YouTube so that's one um and two YouTube doesn't really like ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
20,00:05:40.000,they're shorts on YouTube so that's one um and two YouTube doesn't really like really short content anyway when it starts going into the horizontal layout you then want it to be like upwards of 4 minutes generally so we're going to change this into a vertical video and you know what while we're here a a few ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
21,00:05:56.000,change this into a vertical video and you know what while we're here a a few people ask me what these lines are um can I oh you know what I'm not using I'm going to turn my Pro mouse on yeah cuz then I can show you stuff Pro mouse great love it so if you want to know what these lines are here people like ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
22,00:06:12.000,great love it so if you want to know what these lines are here people like occasionally I get comments like what's that on your screen it's not on my screen and that's a totally fair comment um let's get oh it's gotten rid of over here I have the safety margins turned on I generally this turned on I'm used to ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
23,00:06:26.000,here I have the safety margins turned on I generally this turned on I'm used to just seeing videos when I'm editing with it unless I'm doing a final look where I'll turn them off um if you don't see this you can go to the little plus button over here and then just drag it in from wherever it is in this mess or ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
24,00:06:39.000,button over here and then just drag it in from wherever it is in this mess or it's not there because I've got it right no it's right here it's right here sometimes these move about for me maybe it's the dislexic thing I don't know so and by that I mean I have dyslexia I'm not saying anything else I know I do ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
25,00:06:54.000,so and by that I mean I have dyslexia I'm not saying anything else I know I do so these are actually title and action safe zones so if you're actually creating content and this will be useful as well if you're creating content the inner border here this inner square is known as like the graphics and text safe ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
26,00:07:08.000,inner border here this inner square is known as like the graphics and text safe Zone um this was became a thing in broadcast broadcasting in general and actually Maddie comes from television so we're used to this where because some screens are responsive have you ever noticed when a video sometimes is ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
27,00:07:23.000,screens are responsive have you ever noticed when a video sometimes is cropped and then some things get cut off from people that put graphics and text too far in the edges particularly on social video that's why it's to account for other people's screens responsive videos it's like when you double tap ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
28,00:07:34.000,for other people's screens responsive videos it's like when you double tap into um the video you're watching on a phone and it crops out the edges the bars so it's to protect text not getting cropped off when you do things like that if you change how you view and then this outside box here is very similar but ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
29,00:07:49.000,if you change how you view and then this outside box here is very similar but it's What's called the action safe zone so in theory anything anything that like goes on in the screen you want it to happen in that box now there are you know reasons why you might not want that but generally the idea is that's not ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
30,00:08:04.000,know reasons why you might not want that but generally the idea is that's not going to get cropped off then and people aren't going to miss information they need to but you know what we'll turn it off for the moment so let's reframe this all I'm going to do is I'm going to go up to my ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
31,00:08:13.000,moment so let's reframe this all I'm going to do is I'm going to go up to my sequence which is up here just for those of you who don't know it's over here and I'm going to rightclick it and just simply click Auto reframe sequence cuz this is a completely edited finish sequence now now we get this box this ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
32,00:08:28.000,this is a completely edited finish sequence now now we get this box this box is going to give you options and you can change the name we're going to just keep this and the target as ratio is it's going to transform I know it's going to transform the video inside like in the sequence from in this case a a ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
33,00:08:45.000,going to transform the video inside like in the sequence from in this case a a 169 to either a square which is 1 by one a vertical video which is uh here it's 4 .5 which is for more Instagram posts so you know when people are doing carousels and they're like vertical but they're not like full screen that's a 4x5 ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
34,00:09:03.000,and they're like vertical but they're not like full screen that's a 4x5 typically we've got vertical which is full like it's been tipped 916 so that's the reverse of the horizontal and then horizontal is what our thing already is or you can do a custom one but for today we're going vertical I feel like this is ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
35,00:09:19.000,or you can do a custom one but for today we're going vertical I feel like this is probably the most used one we have slower motion now you can change to default or faster motion I prefer slower motion um the reason for that is I'm happy to change Clips on an individual basis but I find slower motion I usually ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
36,00:09:33.000,happy to change Clips on an individual basis but I find slower motion I usually end up transforming Clips to slow motion so there is that and then you get an option here which is clip nesting now if you come from other softwares nests are similar to compound Clips but um basically I don't want it to nest ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
37,00:09:46.000,similar to compound Clips but um basically I don't want it to nest because I don't want it to replace any motions I may have put in there already um whereas like if if I want it to Nest Clips it's going to keep the Motions that I may have already put on footage but it's going to remove Transitions and ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
38,00:10:02.000,that I may have already put on footage but it's going to remove Transitions and stuff and it will re it will do it's basically a way for it to put a clip in a clip so that it can do some motion but we're not nesting Clips you won't need to Nest Clips like nine times out of 10 so create and it's already done it you ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
39,00:10:17.000,to Nest Clips like nine times out of 10 so create and it's already done it you can see at the bottom down here it's just giving it an analyze so we're just going to let it do its thing for a second because it's nearly done wonderful and it's done so let's see what it's done it's not going to be 100% ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
40,00:10:29.000,wonderful and it's done so let's see what it's done it's not going to be 100% none of these tools these are AI tools none of them are going to be 100% but they'll get me 90% of the way there I find onet hey ready for someone's eager pain brush every 10 ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
41,00:10:45.000,onet hey ready for someone's eager pain brush every 10 days beep up you just call it the Beeper roll no [Music] to paint so I think we should do two ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
42,00:11:04.000,[Music] to paint so I think we should do two shots oh I'm so sorry okay oh that's actually way better than I thought it was going to be particularly this last clip you know I'm just impressed that it knew I was focusing on the Lori and then ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
43,00:11:24.000,just impressed that it knew I was focusing on the Lori and then forklift pickup truck one of those and then it just followed Maddie who was the main person on screen and it follows her off I think it does did a great job love that for us for a minute while we just have a look I'm going to mute everything ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
44,00:11:40.000,that for us for a minute while we just have a look I'm going to mute everything so that you know we can skim it and you know what I'm going to move to a vertical setup so we can see this video better great I'm just going to have to find my effect controls so this one great this one ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
45,00:11:55.000,find my effect controls so this one great this one great can we zoom in or out let's have a look at the original motion no uh you know what this one could do with um you know offsetting a bit so we're just going to change this by using the ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
46,00:12:11.000,um you know offsetting a bit so we're just going to change this by using the offset if you wanted to redo some of these key frames you would go over right key frames and then you can click them delete them and do whatever you like but we're not doing that we're just going to change the offset um um that's too far ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
47,00:12:26.000,we're not doing that we're just going to change the offset um um that's too far because I was just showing you what was happening but I like moving her over a bit because she's looking to that side of the screen um this one again I want to offset it so we can see that brush a bit ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
48,00:12:36.000,screen um this one again I want to offset it so we can see that brush a bit more um fine offset that just a little bit it works it's tracking her face but I I think I prefer it when you see some of the uh paint here in the background uh yep dancing great great ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
49,00:12:52.000,the uh paint here in the background uh yep dancing great great great great great this did a good job yeah you know what that's fine I could be picky but that works uh this one I would want to move over oh I'm just zipping around too fast there probably ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
50,00:13:08.000,just zipping around too fast there probably here fine fine oh this one is out completely easily fixed and great like that's how quick it was we have our vertical video now we are going to move on to captioning so captions you can go up to ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
51,00:13:28.000,are going to move on to captioning so captions you can go up to text up here um if again if you don't have that window I showed you how to find it earlier it says currently no dialogue found so we need to enable oh right I have to unmute takes me a second so it's already yeah I was ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4

53,00:13:57.000,transcription and automatically transcribe Clips over here at the top um it just makes things easier for me it means it's doing something in the background sometimes when I'm busy so you can enable that there and it's already done it so if I want captions I can just go to this button and click ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
54,00:14:11.000,already done it so if I want captions I can just go to this button and click create captions um let's have a look at our preferences bring this up here so we can all see it better now we all have seen those captions where it's like one word on screen um I want ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4

58,00:15:10.000,personally and we're going to give this a go and create captions and it's already done it for us which is great so I want these captions to either disappear when the audio disappears or come off screen I might have still had that too long let's see what happens okay so it doesn't know that that's a ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
59,00:15:23.000,that too long let's see what happens okay so it doesn't know that that's a cattle it's really easy to change these you just go into here and change them up here quite on set and then we can make this smaller my main thing on my first pass is to make sure it's all on the clip ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
60,00:15:40.000,pass is to make sure it's all on the clip [Music] hey uh she doesn't say ready but okay we're good and then ready for someone eain okay so it didn't get ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
61,00:15:57.000,then ready for someone eain okay so it didn't get ready so we're just going to very quickly edit these for some ones you get paint brush every 10 days days I just want to make sure that cuts in the ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
62,00:16:17.000,days days I just want to make sure that cuts in the cut people she says beep I don't blame it for not getting that beep [Music] um we can get rid of that first one cuz there's no real she's not saying it but ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
63,00:16:34.000,um we can get rid of that first one cuz there's no real she's not saying it but we can go beep beep um make sure that's on the cut if you're not seeing these lines by the way just make sure this magnet is switched on okay great um yeah that that's ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
64,00:16:49.000,on okay great um yeah that that's fine just got it the Beeper roll beeper roll again sometimes there's accents on these things um let's just call it the beer roll and then we'll make sure that that ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
65,00:17:19.000,call it the beer roll and then we'll make sure that that cuts here no and we'll just have that say no I should have checked the transcription rarely shouldn't I this would have saved us some ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
66,00:17:40.000,transcription rarely shouldn't I this would have saved us some time okay and for sake we'll pretend we've done it now you know because what I want to quickly show you to finish these off is you can go here you can change just this one for example um I want to change change it to I think the ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
67,00:17:54.000,change just this one for example um I want to change change it to I think the center uh will have a different front I think there is one was the one that Maddie likes um you know what can't remember off the top of my head let's see if I've got don't have Brandon in here let's go ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
68,00:18:11.000,see if I've got don't have Brandon in here let's go for a nice chunky Sans serif Poppins um is it a sand serif it's a siif it's a sand serif I'm pretty sure I might have got wrong you never know we'll go for nice chunky Poppins we'll ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
69,00:18:28.000,might have got wrong you never know we'll go for nice chunky Poppins we'll make it a bit bigger and we'll give it a stroke The Strokes are fun cuz actually you can double them up now so let's give this um we'll use the paint topper and give this a yellow maybe not yellow here let's go ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
70,00:18:42.000,give this a yellow maybe not yellow here let's go Blue um nice more Tey blue there we go and we can add a stroke if we wanted now um that didn't always used to be the case fun fact we'll go with the yellow you know what ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
71,00:18:58.000,fun fact we'll go with the yellow you know what that doesn't look good we tried um we can always just turn that off so this make it maybe a bit chunky and if we love what we've done cuz at the moment it's only on that clip right it's not on the rest of them ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
72,00:19:13.000,cuz at the moment it's only on that clip right it's not on the rest of them because also when you're doing vertical video you don't want your captions on the bottom it's going to get covered by description boxes and all sorts so we're going to click that go up to here and just simply say redefine style you know ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
73,00:19:23.000,going to click that go up to here and just simply say redefine style you know what what we should do is save the style and then push it out because we'll save time later then so let's head back into Premier and to save your style you just click the plus create style and be like MADD ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
74,00:19:40.000,click the plus create style and be like MADD test you can save it to your project and click okay and there it is so once your style is there you can then just push it out to all the captions on your track and they should all have done that which is great love that for us so now ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
75,00:19:57.000,track and they should all have done that which is great love that for us so now that we've edited our video we've now made it ready for vertical video we're going to export it you can either go to the export tab up here or just click command or control if you're on a Windows M and it should open up this ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
76,00:20:12.000,command or control if you're on a Windows M and it should open up this screen now you can actually export straight to Tik Tok Now by enabling this button over here and signing into your Tik Tok account which is really exciting if you want to do it and the best thing thing is you can actually save it to one ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
77,00:20:27.000,if you want to do it and the best thing thing is you can actually save it to one one your drafts it's not just going to post immediately and that way you don't have to fill in all of this stuff either you can do that natively in the app which is awesome or you can you know post it straight to the app put in um ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
78,00:20:39.000,which is awesome or you can you know post it straight to the app put in um tell that you want that users to comment duet and Stitch and you can also delete the local file now I don't recommend that always keep a file not on a streaming platform have like a hard cop Cy as it were um but you can just do ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
79,00:20:56.000,streaming platform have like a hard cop Cy as it were um but you can just do that all from YouTube and it knows the settings for you which is great or you can oh and while you're doing that by the way when you're doing your captions you are going to want to turn these on and say burn them into the video if you ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
80,00:21:12.000,you are going to want to turn these on and say burn them into the video if you want to use your captions otherwise they're not going to show up it's going to export a copy without them you can also do that by sending straight to Youtube as well but I will say if it is a short you cannot upload a thumbnail ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
81,00:21:24.000,Youtube as well but I will say if it is a short you cannot upload a thumbnail so there is that my preferred way is using the media file settings I'll always opt for a h264 cuz most social media platforms do currently prefer that but we are moving to h265 that's a whole other thing and ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
82,00:21:39.000,currently prefer that but we are moving to h265 that's a whole other thing and then I just go adaptive High bit rate I look at my video I click more I always render out maximum depth I use maximum render quality and then I go down to our B bit rate settings this is really important ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
83,00:21:53.000,quality and then I go down to our B bit rate settings this is really important so I really quickly want to touch on bit rate settings I'm going to have to read them off my screen if it if if it was a YouTube video that is a 4K video you want a bit rate of between 35 and 45 megabits per second if it's 1080 video ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
84,00:22:09.000,want a bit rate of between 35 and 45 megabits per second if it's 1080 video you want it to be between 8 and 15 I generally for 1080 go for about 15 16 it seems to be a pretty good Mark um also for Instagram if it prefers 1080 export not 4K if you export it and upload it 4K it might look ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
85,00:22:29.000,it prefers 1080 export not 4K if you export it and upload it 4K it might look worse cuz it's going to recompress that worse so export 1080 it prefers 30 frames a second and again around the same kind of bit rate um I think you could go as low as eight which is insane but we're just going to go for 15 and ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
86,00:22:45.000,could go as low as eight which is insane but we're just going to go for 15 and there's two things you can do you can send to medeor encoder if and that what it does is it sends it to the other app which is medor encoder and it then exports it for you in the background so you can keep editing on premere or you ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
87,00:22:59.000,exports it for you in the background so you can keep editing on premere or you just simply click export and you're done we did it I can't believe I was like I think I'm going to run out of time to talk about exporting but I didn't um I think we have a couple of extra minutes here so I'm going to go ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
88,00:23:13.000,but I didn't um I think we have a couple of extra minutes here so I'm going to go through what all this means cuz this can be really really daunting so you want to have a look at your file size down here that's important for knowing how big your video is for example Instagram doesn't like videos over 1 gig so that's ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
89,00:23:26.000,your video is for example Instagram doesn't like videos over 1 gig so that's something to be aware of um it's not really built for long form yet I know they've been trying on and off years but that's not what reals is about let's be real oh come on I was proud of that one um you can see here actually this ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
90,00:23:40.000,real oh come on I was proud of that one um you can see here actually this video is in 4k I wouldn't want that so I'd probably put this into a 1080p timeline that might be a better idea um yeah I think that would probably be a better idea than all of this um Square pixels usual I have 25 frames a second ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
91,00:24:00.000,better idea than all of this um Square pixels usual I have 25 frames a second but that's because I'm in Europe so I use pal tissue which means it's 25 frames if you're in America or Japan or South America the Americas in general North and South um you you're probably on ntsc so you're going to be using a ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
92,00:24:15.000,North and South um you you're probably on ntsc so you're going to be using a 23.98 six frame rate or 24 frame frame rate or a 30 frame rate 30 is a good one honestly for social media generally is and those are kind of the key things you're going to be looking for um there's one pass and two pass I didn't ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
93,00:24:33.000,you're going to be looking for um there's one pass and two pass I didn't go through two pass two pass is where it goes through the video slower because it's basically doing it twice to check and you set in a minimum here um and a ma like the target's 15 but it can do till 20 for example if there's some ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
94,00:24:47.000,ma like the target's 15 but it can do till 20 for example if there's some complicated graphics and you don't want them to look compressed um if it's a client I will do two pass if it's my I do one pass cuz I don't mind um I'll just watch the export first before I put it up generally as a good rule of thumb ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
95,00:25:01.000,just watch the export first before I put it up generally as a good rule of thumb anyway I think that's kind of it for today that means this is my last live so we're done we got a lot done in 30 minutes as always sometimes we've had a little bit less but we're not going to talk about ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4
96,00:25:17.000,little bit less but we're not going to talk about it but I want you to look out for all the other lives on beans they are incredible resources they're showing some sneaks as well of new stuff on and off did you catch Jason LaVine last week talking about some new features I ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qh_rguqdD4

108,00:01:53.000,submit your work uh we love talking and uh kind of posting stuff that we worked on the you can see some stuff from last week that we had a ton of fun with but yeah let's just hop in the illustrator let's talk about what we're doing today and uh let's learn some stuff so over here in illustrator you'll see I have a ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
109,00:02:08.000,and uh let's learn some stuff so over here in illustrator you'll see I have a little character that I've drawn uh today is going to be all about creating stickers sticker mockups uh pretty much just having assets either for your thumbnails for uh Instagram or for YouTube or even if you just want to you ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
110,00:02:24.000,thumbnails for uh Instagram or for YouTube or even if you just want to you know mock something up to see if someone's interested in having some stickers from you this is what this is for so the best place to start with this process is obviously having your design in this case I have this little apple ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
111,00:02:38.000,process is obviously having your design in this case I have this little apple here uh you can also use pngs things that are fully uh I guess traced out or imported in make sure they have a transparent background you want it to be you know as uh I guess shaped as possible so you don't have to worry ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
112,00:02:56.000,you know as uh I guess shaped as possible so you don't have to worry about having things clip because we're going to be working in outlines today uh but really anything can work in this case for this case use we're going to be using this vectored design that I did uh really what we're going to be doing is ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
113,00:03:11.000,using this vectored design that I did uh really what we're going to be doing is we're going to be adding some effects in order to make this illustration really pop and make it kind of come across like a sticker there's a few techniques that you can use it's pretty simple uh and there's some really fun use applications ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
114,00:03:29.000,you can use it's pretty simple uh and there's some really fun use applications for that so typically the first thing I like to do is make sure that my image illustrator illustration I should say is grouped up what I'm going to do as well just so we can see two examples is I'm just going ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
115,00:03:45.000,just so we can see two examples is I'm just going to roster this image to make sure it's all on the same layer and this is kind of what we want to avoid right we want to avoid this white kind of shape around and if you're importing a PNG or if you have some art ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
116,00:03:59.000,white kind of shape around and if you're importing a PNG or if you have some art that you maybe are reusing on a background the easiest way to get rid of this white box around your character is by going up to object image Trace make an expand and we'll have a ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
117,00:04:16.000,an expand and we'll have a little panel like this that will show up and what we can do is we can just click okay and then it will expand those objects if you go over to the direct selection tool you can click on this background and you can delete it there ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
118,00:04:33.000,selection tool you can click on this background and you can delete it there you go now you have a flat image that you can use for this process if you are like me and you're working in your vectored work and you want to keep the outlines uh I should say if you want to keep your PIN tool connected to where ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
119,00:04:51.000,outlines uh I should say if you want to keep your PIN tool connected to where you can resize this however you want just make sure when you do go to your let's see edit I believe I'm looking for the transform tool somewhere around here there we go go to window transform ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
120,00:05:06.000,around here there we go go to window transform and just make sure your scale corners and scale strokes and effects are turned on just because if you are going to be using this for promo you want to make sure that your stroke sizes accordingly instead of having this weird like thin ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
121,00:05:23.000,sure that your stroke sizes accordingly instead of having this weird like thin shaped character it's never fun just a little tip you know just for some practical use so first step if you want to add that outline around your character this is my favorite way to do it uh there are easier ways to do it of ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
122,00:05:40.000,character this is my favorite way to do it uh there are easier ways to do it of course but I find this to be the fastest all you want to do what I'm going to do actually even before we get started with that is I'm just going to make a background color on our artboard just so you can see that differentiation of the ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
123,00:05:54.000,background color on our artboard just so you can see that differentiation of the character and the stroke all I'm doing here is going over to the uh rectangle option choosing the color of the background or I should say the the outside of the artboard making it the shape of the artboard and I'm just going ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
124,00:06:08.000,outside of the artboard making it the shape of the artboard and I'm just going to bring it all the way down to the bottom so we can see our characters and lock that image so what you can do is click on your character and all you need to do is Click command C and command V and you'll see that I copied my ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
125,00:06:22.000,to do is Click command C and command V and you'll see that I copied my character over here and you can drag it over top and try to get it all centered up you could use the Align tool to get these all centered up but even over that my favorite method which is not what I did initially is just click shift ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
126,00:06:37.000,my favorite method which is not what I did initially is just click shift command V and it'll paste right on top of that image so you don't have to worry about it being unaligned now what I like to do is I like to name or label my uh designs or my ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
127,00:06:50.000,like to name or label my uh designs or my characters uh and my layers just so I know what I'm working with so I'll go ahead and name this first layer art and I'll name the second layer stroke now that I have my art and my stroke layer labeled what I can do is I ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
128,00:07:06.000,stroke now that I have my art and my stroke layer labeled what I can do is I can go ahead and turn off the view of my art you'll probably notice that there isn't much of a difference but what you can do now is click on your stroke uh stroke layer I should say go to the stroke panel if you don't see the stroke ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
129,00:07:23.000,stroke layer I should say go to the stroke panel if you don't see the stroke panel you can just go over to window stroke and that'll bring up the stroke panel and what I want to do is I want to create a stroke around this image so what I can do is just click on the weight up arrow and add a bit of a ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
130,00:07:37.000,what I can do is just click on the weight up arrow and add a bit of a stroke to this image you'll probably immediately notice something with this design and with this stroke effect and that is that it is creating the stroke on the inside and that's something that we can't really change when we're ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
131,00:07:53.000,on the inside and that's something that we can't really change when we're working in vectors or working with pngs and that is why I like to do this method because if we go over to our stroke let's go ahead and change the color to white you'll see we'll kind of have this like filled out shape kind of look and ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
132,00:08:05.000,white you'll see we'll kind of have this like filled out shape kind of look and when we turn on our art it gives us this nice outline around it you can adjust that stroke layer as much or as little as you want so say let's zoom in a little bit here we want to turn this down and have a bit of a ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
133,00:08:19.000,let's zoom in a little bit here we want to turn this down and have a bit of a smaller stroke or if we want to turn it up have a really really thick stroke like a die cut sticker we can do that I personally like the thicker Strokes just because it's a bit of a nicer Vibe and it feels like you're just peeling the ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
134,00:08:34.000,because it's a bit of a nicer Vibe and it feels like you're just peeling the sticker right off so what you can do after you are happy with your stroke size is you can just go ahead and highlight your whole image click command G and over here you'll see It'll group that and we'll name this ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
135,00:08:47.000,G and over here you'll see It'll group that and we'll name this apple sticker one perfect so we've got a general idea down of how to make our stroke around our image but what if we have a vector shape what if we have something that isn't a PNG well it's actually pretty simple and it's going to ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
136,00:09:04.000,something that isn't a PNG well it's actually pretty simple and it's going to be kind of the same process so what we're going to do is we're just going to click command C and command V we're going to go ahead and if you want you can rename your group since we are working on a bit of a time limit I'm ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
137,00:09:16.000,can rename your group since we are working on a bit of a time limit I'm just going to go ahead and work through this without naming my groups probably not the smartest idea but hey we're working on a time limit so I'll go ahead and remove this top image and I'm going to click on my character and again go to ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
138,00:09:29.000,and remove this top image and I'm going to click on my character and again go to object image Trace whoops actually even before image tracing make sure you roster IE so we'll roster IE go to object image Trace make an expand go ahead and click okay it'll expand that image and then we can just delete this ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
139,00:09:49.000,ahead and click okay it'll expand that image and then we can just delete this background same as this character over here with the direct selection tool clicking on that background and then clicking delete then same as this over here we can just go to our stroke panel go ahead and make the stroke about 90 ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
140,00:10:03.000,here we can just go to our stroke panel go ahead and make the stroke about 90 because that's what we liked you'll notice with this specific character because it isn't image traced and because there are still some outlines that are being preserved in this image uh you'll see some little spikes that's ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
141,00:10:18.000,that are being preserved in this image uh you'll see some little spikes that's just because with these Corners uh automatically you're going to have these miter joints Co I guess is what you're called like the butt Caps or the what I essentially what I'm trying to say is the flat sharp edges if you want to ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
142,00:10:33.000,essentially what I'm trying to say is the flat sharp edges if you want to change that all you need to do is just click on these rounded edges and then these will go away and then you can just turn on your image your top layer and look we have the same exact image same exact ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
143,00:10:43.000,your image your top layer and look we have the same exact image same exact layer super easy super fast and very convenient and when you are extending your image then you can scale this up or down as small or as large as you want so we can go even further with this too we can add even more effects to these ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
144,00:11:03.000,we can go even further with this too we can add even more effects to these stickers and one of my favorite ways to really highlight something is a sticker is by first of course throwing it on a white background and I bet you're wondering well you can't see the outline anymore Jacob why would you throw it on ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
145,00:11:16.000,wondering well you can't see the outline anymore Jacob why would you throw it on a white background well there's a little Technique we can use by clicking on our bottom group going over to the effects panel clicking stylize in the top section under the illustrator effects not the ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
146,00:11:30.000,clicking stylize in the top section under the illustrator effects not the Photoshop effects and then clicking drop shadow and you'll notice of course as the name States we have a bit of a drop shadow what I'm going to do I'm just going to exit out of this panel real quick and zoom in a little further so ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
147,00:11:44.000,going to exit out of this panel real quick and zoom in a little further so let's go effect stylize drop shadow and now you can see that we're kind of getting this like you know 3D text effect which I really really like typically I like to keep this on multiply but I would mess around with it ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
148,00:11:58.000,typically I like to keep this on multiply but I would mess around with it however you see fit I'm going to go ahead and extend these edges a little bit the Y offset is going to bring your Shadow up or down and your X offset is going to bring it left or right very very ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
149,00:12:13.000,going to bring it left or right very very easy editing the blur tool here is just going to give your Shadow a bit more of a softer Edge it's going to disperse it a little bit differently I usually like to keep mine within like between 10 and 15 ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
150,00:12:26.000,to keep mine within like between 10 and 15 and your color down here is going to of course be the color of your Shadow sometimes I like to mess around with a lighter grayish color which gives it a softer look but for this instance I'm just going to use this black perfect ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
151,00:12:38.000,softer look but for this instance I'm just going to use this black perfect perfect so now we can click okay and we have a nice soft little Edge to our sticker and it's looking even closer and closer to what we're hoping for but this is with black and white right this is with some simple illustrations that you ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
152,00:12:57.000,is with black and white right this is with some simple illustrations that you know they look okay but I want to add some color to this so let's do it with some illustrations that have color same concept I went ahead and on my second artboard over here I prepared some characters that I thought were really ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
153,00:13:12.000,artboard over here I prepared some characters that I thought were really cute obviously these are some fruits and you know just the ones that I immediately think of we've got a peach and orange and an apple similar to this apple over here with some different colors ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
154,00:13:27.000,apple over here with some different colors here funny enough looks like I messed up that right there we'll just fix that but we're going to be approaching this under the same concept I want to just add a background just to make this process a little bit faster but what we'll do is ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
155,00:13:38.000,background just to make this process a little bit faster but what we'll do is we'll actually ungroup these characters just so they're all in their different respective Marquee or reference boxes let's go ahead and make some copies so whoops I'm going to go ahead and command C and shift command V copy this one over ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
156,00:13:55.000,whoops I'm going to go ahead and command C and shift command V copy this one over and let's rename this to top uh or we'll do apple and then we'll do Apple outline we'll do the same for this just click on the character make sure when you're clicking on the character that ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
157,00:14:12.000,click on the character make sure when you're clicking on the character that you're clicking on the character with the selection tool not the direct selection tool because if you do then you're only going to get pieces of your illustration which is never fun make sure your character is also grouped up ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
158,00:14:23.000,illustration which is never fun make sure your character is also grouped up because you don't want to make you don't want make any mistakes in copying over some parts of the image and then them not being retained in the outline it just can be a whole mess so we'll go ahead and click command C shift command ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
159,00:14:36.000,just can be a whole mess so we'll go ahead and click command C shift command V and it went ahead and pasted that image over top and we'll just drag this down with the direct selection tool we'll go orange and [Music] ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
160,00:14:49.000,orange and [Music] orange outline and then we'll do that same exact process with the peach peach and peach outline perfect so we'll go ahead and ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
161,00:15:04.000,peach and peach outline perfect so we'll go ahead and remove all of these top layers of these characters and let's go ahead and start rostering and image tracing these characters you'll notice with the image Trace tool on its normal setting that when you image Trace these character ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s

163,00:15:37.000,regardless so I'm just quickly implementing that effect that we talked about by just rostering all these layers image tracing them you'll get some funny effects especially if you're only on a two color uh image Trace setting I think it's really funny when you have the outlines kind of bleed into the actual ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
164,00:15:54.000,it's really funny when you have the outlines kind of bleed into the actual character itself just image Trace one more time that one looks like it did not want to read that an easy way to fix that is just by clicking on your character itself and making these outlines black ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
165,00:16:10.000,just by clicking on your character itself and making these outlines black again the actual coloring of the character isn't as important sometimes if your illustration is too light then it is going to pick up those colors as white which is never good and when I say pick up I mean the image Trace tool ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
166,00:16:26.000,white which is never good and when I say pick up I mean the image Trace tool itself so we'll go ahead and just image Trace make an expand and look at that easy peasy we'll delete that background and we can actually just click all these at once if we want to we can highlight it with the ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s

171,00:17:54.000,that's my favorite part about doing these Vector designs or adding these kind of mockup scker effects as we can do more the easiest way to do that is in my opinion adding it to an image and for that we're going to go over to Adobe stock Adobe has some great free options that we can use to really utilize um I ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s

184,00:21:33.000,know we drag this over on top of our image let's make sure we're actually above the image here in the layers panel you'll notice that it's underneath our linked file so we can just drag that on top I like this but you know I feel like there can be more added to it right I feel like this could ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
185,00:21:49.000,there can be more added to it right I feel like this could be this could stand out even more and it's a little distracting with the you know the Fruit Stand so what I can do is I can actually click on that image let's go to effects stylize down ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR_mlBb-5-k&t=1211s
