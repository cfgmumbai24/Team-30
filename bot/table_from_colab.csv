159,00:05:04.000,"You already have this template here that you can use but if you want to add
bleed to a basic shape like this or maybe even have these flaps here that were
to add things you can go ahead and use offset path for that. We won't be
covering how to make a DI line because this stream is not about that. This
stream is about how to made your own packaging when you already have a template.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L65CxuCt-bg
160,00:06:21.000,maybe like use some of these illustrations to create our designs today um I'm going to use the dimension tool just to like make this a little bit bigger as well so if you are in your layers panel just go ahead and unlock all of these except maybe the challenge layer just unlock all the layers and then we can do the same thing together so I'm going to select all of this and press option and shift and then like make it bigger because I just want to see it on my screen and obviously this can change depending on what page you're printing it at what size um you think is good for what your purposes are um the dimension tool sits right over here in the toolbar I am in the essentials classic workspace so it's right over here in the dimension it says Dimension and the good thing is that you hover on it it you can actually see what it does so it's linear angular and you can read all about it again at this page so it can be um linear Dimension angular and Radial Dimension and this shows you like the three ways you can actually do it so let's go back here click on the dimension tool and it gives you these options where it's like linear Dimension reg angular and um the radial you can go ahead and have all these Dimension tool up options which I think are super cool because you can go ahead change the document unit here as well Precision um change the scale one to one which is so cool because in architecture or like engineering drawing you actually um can make things to scale or like tell the scale in the um drawing itself you can change the default line weight the line type as well I think I want a dash line ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L65CxuCt-bg

be um linear Dimension angular and Radial Dimension.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L65CxuCt-bg

334,00:04:30.000,that I may take next because I'm sitting on a rized file which could be maybe I want to select the subject maybe I want to remove a background and in fact it's right I want to remove the background of this subject or I can select it as well but if you find yourself looking at this and it looks different that is because that bar is called the contextual Bar for a reason it moves in the context of whatever you're working on and that's going to generate different uh remarks basically that are going to prompt you to do a different action so here it tells me if I want to generate a background which in fact I can or if I want to import an image and all of these different variations so pay attention to that because that's really cool to uh become familiar with so as I'm here I'm going to uh increase this right about there and decrease this and put it in the foreground and I think I'm going to also flip it horizontally so it's facing outwards when you flip something horizontally just watch out there's no text or type that just became completely illegible illegible once you turned it or flipped it so you can see here there's some areas that didn't go so well in this T tid bit so what's okay okay about this is this process is that you're able to always access that mask so I can bring back some of the detail or information without having to worry that I'm going to lose all that information once it removed my background it removes the background but it kind of stores it safely away right so I might want to do something like ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2k1pHKSHtg

336,00:05:59.000,okay about this is this process is that you're able to always access that mask so I can bring back some of the detail or information without having to worry that I'm going to lose all that information once it removed my background it removes the background but it kind of stores it safely away right so I might want to do something like this to just bring back those areas I want using the color white right so that's the way I'm going to go about it and I can also revise any other areas that don't work for me so holding alt or option there it's going to give you that U visibility so now my thumb is back awesome it's nice to have a a thumb back so I'm going to play around with these a little bit and add some funky effects here I'm going to add a sort of cutout element because we're navigating how this would be if it was an analog image right like if I had actually copied and pasted this or cut this out out of a magazine so I'm going to make this selection it it made a shape for me which I don't actually need um and I'm going to fill that mask in that area with block so it removes it but it's only going to store it safely as we said before so when it comes to this area I want to pretend it's Hollow right like there's there's some kind of whimsicle to it and it has a shape of its own has kind of this thing going on we don't want to go to over maybe something like that and I think here is actually a good opportunity to reshape that selection that you made to so maybe like [Music] ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2k1pHKSHtg

right we can try a differentcolor for this one"" ""I want even space between the
selections and doing the same thing I'mgoing to fill that with black and again
I'mGoing to create a shape that makes it appear like it's Hollow and so that's
going to be with the pen tools"" ""So I got that cool effect and I can do it one
more time here hitting the P again to I'm Going to sacrifice this this this um
this bracelet here""",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2k1pHKSHtg
340,00:09:15.000,one um oh didn't I select a different color you were there you saw me okay so command backspace and voila we got this kind of cutout effect in it and that looks so much better so now something I wanted to show you about that cutout effect and how we can translate that over in my experimentation of collaging I found myself also exploring things like this I wanted to show you this collaging because it is in essence how collaging was born you really just cut out the different pieces and create these Hollow spaces these negative spaces that can go over just about anything and they can be really really fun to play with right so I put it over this print here and it was fun because my wife and I were uh playing around with collaging at at a point here because it's got really fun and she picked this copy right here that says shift your outlook and so that's nice because that's our type element of our design when I put this together I really had to think about scale here too because as in this process it's a little bit different because we have to cut out and decisively pick our ingredients um and that is going to then be redefined by our layout because I can easily put this instead in the center and this becomes a far brand new artwork right so it gives you a different sense of appreciation for collaging in a different way so if I move on back to much easier grounds which is going to be our Photoshop space you're going to see that here we're able to make those cutouts so much simpler we don't have to worry ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2k1pHKSHtg
341,00:09:15.000,"This is a collaging of a print that my wife and I were uh playing around with
collaging at at a point here because it's got really fun and she picked this
copy right here that says shift your outlook and so that's nice because that's
our type element of our design when I put this together I really had to think
about scale here too because as in this process it's a little bit different.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2k1pHKSHtg
342,00:11:00.000,and this becomes a far brand new artwork right so it gives you a different sense of appreciation for collaging in a different way so if I move on back to much easier grounds which is going to be our Photoshop space you're going to see that here we're able to make those cutouts so much simpler we don't have to worry about Selec the ingredients that we don't want and not having other options and what I mean by that is if we move away from portraits now we're going to start to have to build this environment so I love in collaging I love exploring a base where my Center focus is going to be be in and an environment so we're going to build that up with generative fill things that we can't do in paper collaging which is quite wonderful to explore right so under here those are my textures by the way which we will talk about so under here what I could do is I can select an area to start adding elements to but I don't want this to give me any in uh contextual generation what I mean by that is I don't want it to use that as it generates um I don't want it to use it as information so I rather use a blind ch so I turned off the other ones and I'm going to generate clouds here and that's it that's all I will be generating in this one and what's really peculiar about this process is that when it comes to generative fill anything can happen we can be generating just about anything you give it a small guide but then it can create a variation of that that is different every time right so I love being able to do that though because that leaves it for a lot of um a lot of ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2k1pHKSHtg
