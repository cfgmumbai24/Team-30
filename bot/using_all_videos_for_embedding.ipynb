      "Id: 151, Start: 151, Overview: many of them actually start with pen and paper you know or pencil and paper because it's the original way of creating art I think you know before they bring it into a digital tool they always start sketching they say in their little sketchbooks or just a piece of paper they find around so I think it's ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 200, Start: 200, Overview: that don't exist in one realm or the other so I kind of have to giggle a little bit when people ask me about my process because it's very nonlinear it's almost frantically you know back and forth between those two Realms but if I were to work on a popup project for example I might start by looking at ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 214, Start: 214, Overview: were to work on a popup project for example I might start by looking at other popup books seeing how other artists like use the basic mechanisms in that popup book toolkit and then imagine what it could be and I tend to start like you were saying the same way where I am just working with paper and Pen ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 249, Start: 249, Overview: need to be I love that back and forth your newest work involves reor graph Printing and animation that sounds so cool but I am not the one to describe it for sure can you tell my audience what that is and why it resonates with you so it looks like a copy machine looks like it would be super boring but it's kind ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 267, Start: 267, Overview: it looks like a copy machine looks like it would be super boring but it's kind of like if you took a silk screen studio and like trapped them in that beige box so the process is is most similar to silk screen and that it's burning a stencil but it's doing it in this kind of like fast food way so with silk ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 281, Start: 281, Overview: stencil but it's doing it in this kind of like fast food way so with silk screen you need the silk screen you need to burn an image out of it and then you can press ink through it and with the Rizo it does all of that like within the box of the machine and it uses rice paper to create the stencil it's a lot ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 311, Start: 311, Overview: something you can tweak it in your file and then send it again and so it's really really good for for experimentation I discovered this technique just by playing around with my friend's machine and wondering would this be possible where I create animation frames ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 326, Start: 326, Overview: this be possible where I create animation frames in the typical way I usually use After Effects honestly sometimes I do like a Photoshop like GIF but then you can take those frames you can arrange them on a contact sheet and then you can print them out on the Rizo so the Rizo has an ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 375, Start: 375, Overview: of laundering animations that feel like too digital or too cold and it's a way to make them feel like more organic more touchable and the Rizo is so fun because it has all of these fluorescent colors and like spot colors cornflower blue fluorescent orange so yeah it's uh it's fun and I've been ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 403, Start: 403, Overview: it's an iPhone video or an animation they crafted and we prep the art together it takes like three hours for everyone to do it on their computers but then we'll print it in The Print Shop scan it back in and then they put it back together again and like at the beginning I was kind of like because ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 418, Start: 418, Overview: back together again and like at the beginning I was kind of like because it's a technique I came I came up with and I was like what do I do with this and it really has been so fulfilling to share it with other people and see what other people's spins are on it and you know what potential people see in the ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 128, Start: 128, Overview: and uh let's learn some stuff so over here in illustrator you'll see I have a little character that I've drawn uh today is going to be all about creating stickers sticker mockups uh pretty much just having assets either for your thumbnails for uh Instagram or for YouTube or even if you just want to you ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 144, Start: 144, Overview: thumbnails for uh Instagram or for YouTube or even if you just want to you know mock something up to see if someone's interested in having some stickers from you this is what this is for so the best place to start with this process is obviously having your design in this case I have this little apple ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 158, Start: 158, Overview: process is obviously having your design in this case I have this little apple here uh you can also use pngs things that are fully uh I guess traced out or imported in make sure they have a transparent background you want it to be you know as uh I guess shaped as possible so you don't have to worry ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 176, Start: 176, Overview: you know as uh I guess shaped as possible so you don't have to worry about having things clip because we're going to be working in outlines today uh but really anything can work in this case for this case use we're going to be using this vectored design that I did uh really what we're going to be doing is ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 191, Start: 191, Overview: using this vectored design that I did uh really what we're going to be doing is we're going to be adding some effects in order to make this illustration really pop and make it kind of come across like a sticker there's a few techniques that you can use it's pretty simple uh and there's some really fun use applications ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 209, Start: 209, Overview: you can use it's pretty simple uh and there's some really fun use applications for that so typically the first thing I like to do is make sure that my image illustrator illustration I should say is grouped up what I'm going to do as well just so we can see two examples is I'm just going ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 225, Start: 225, Overview: just so we can see two examples is I'm just going to roster this image to make sure it's all on the same layer and this is kind of what we want to avoid right we want to avoid this white kind of shape around and if you're importing a PNG or if you have some art ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 239, Start: 239, Overview: white kind of shape around and if you're importing a PNG or if you have some art that you maybe are reusing on a background the easiest way to get rid of this white box around your character is by going up to object image Trace make an expand and we'll have a ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 256, Start: 256, Overview: an expand and we'll have a little panel like this that will show up and what we can do is we can just click okay and then it will expand those objects if you go over to the direct selection tool you can click on this background and you can delete it there ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 273, Start: 273, Overview: selection tool you can click on this background and you can delete it there you go now you have a flat image that you can use for this process if you are like me and you're working in your vectored work and you want to keep the outlines uh I should say if you want to keep your PIN tool connected to where ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 306, Start: 306, Overview: around here there we go go to window transform and just make sure your scale corners and scale strokes and effects are turned on just because if you are going to be using this for promo you want to make sure that your stroke sizes accordingly instead of having this weird like thin ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 1310, Start: 1310, Overview: should turn white and if you go to the left it should turn black and I want to put one on because I think there's so many Clips it it's going to be the only consistent thing over the top of all of them so let's see how that [Applause] looks definitely looking better there ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 577, Start: 577, Overview: really is to capture more detail it's the one you see most likely with podcasts um right now I'm using one to talk to you because I feel like it's just a little bit more controlled and and and it's a little bit more in a studio environment um and it really is a little bit more sensitive to sound ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 590, Start: 590, Overview: studio environment um and it really is a little bit more sensitive to sound depending on the certain settings that you utilize and it really allows you to capture different ranges of frequency which helps with Voice work and things like that so in the in the future of this talk uh once we wrap up a little ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 622, Start: 622, Overview: trick on how to not necessarily need the pop filter anymore now a second one that we have is the dynamic with USB um the dynamic USB is really easy for using on uh your computer it's really easy to use for um you know different devices that are uh mobile or otherwise because they are usually ax or kind of complicated ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 640, Start: 640, Overview: are uh mobile or otherwise because they are usually ax or kind of complicated systems and the USB really allows you to plug plug and play um sometimes the aux is complicated to the point where you have to like connect different audio settings and things like that so if you really want to get into um a dynamic ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 658, Start: 658, Overview: settings and things like that so if you really want to get into um a dynamic kind of situation where you want to move around um the dynamic microphone with the USB would be really useful because it's going to highlight um different like ways in which you're moving around so if you want to do content where ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 673, Start: 673, Overview: like ways in which you're moving around so if you want to do content where you're outside for example you'll see a lot of those like I have friends who do like the ones where they're like uh how much is your apartment type stuff like those types of things you'll probably want to have a d a dynamic ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 686, Start: 686, Overview: those types of things you'll probably want to have a d a dynamic um mic for and um maybe even looking even deeper if you really want to connect it with an actual ax um which is a different type of plugin that would uh probably complicate the situation if you're not too used to it but I would ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 701, Start: 701, Overview: probably complicate the situation if you're not too used to it but I would start off with a USB and that is uh a little less sensitive to background background noise since it is useful for being Dynamic and moving around and then the last but not least one is a lavalier clip now there's ones that are corded ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 717, Start: 717, Overview: the last but not least one is a lavalier clip now there's ones that are corded which makes it um uh less um uh which makes it hard or or less able for the actual audio to be disrupted um but then again there are a ton of ones that are uh that that are um without uh the actual cord that are ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 737, Start: 737, Overview: ton of ones that are uh that that are um without uh the actual cord that are cordless these days that I really really enjoy that um are by r r o d e don't tell anyone I told you that um they are really great mics and I love using them because they are cordless and granted they may not be ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 756, Start: 756, Overview: because they are cordless and granted they may not be lossless or no the other one um but um I'm trying to I'm trying to remember which see yeah this is this is why I did not go to audio recording school but I am in content school so here we are but I will say that there's a difference ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 773, Start: 773, Overview: am in content school so here we are but I will say that there's a difference there's a big difference between your content or your audio that is recorded with a actual chord and one that is recorded without a chord okay because there there's a difference in the condens of your voice now one without a ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 788, Start: 788, Overview: there there's a difference in the condens of your voice now one without a chord is going to be condensed in a way and the one with a chord is not going to be allowing your voice to give you much more range to be used and edited and adjusted and much more clear so just thinking about those things I think are ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 802, Start: 802, Overview: adjusted and much more clear so just thinking about those things I think are really important um and then and you know keeping the mic at a proper range is really really important um you know I recommend keeping your microphone at least 6 to 12 inches from your face um ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 818, Start: 818, Overview: recommend keeping your microphone at least 6 to 12 inches from your face um but when you and that's for a condenser okay if you are with a dynamic uh mic you need to be close you need to be really close and I know that makes people uncomfortable but I've seen ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 835, Start: 835, Overview: need to be really close and I know that makes people uncomfortable but I've seen it on panels I've seen it in public I've seen it in many different cases where people are too afraid to get close to the dynamic mic and they sound like you can't hear what they're saying you know there's no there's just no tone there ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 847, Start: 847, Overview: can't hear what they're saying you know there's no there's just no tone there there's no emotion and the issue is is that that's because the dynamic will pick up um a lot of different range and it's less sensitive to that background background noise than the condenser so you really have to make sure that you're ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 863, Start: 863, Overview: background noise than the condenser so you really have to make sure that you're you're like pressing that condenser to your face and that's why you have always have to ask people make sure you ask people can you clean my mic before I'm using it if you're on a panel or something or if you're presenting ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 876, Start: 876, Overview: using it if you're on a panel or something or if you're presenting because oh oh my I have seen some mics you guys that are just terrifying I don't even want I don't even want to talk about it I'm scared even saying it but wash watch the mics wash them and make sure that you keep you keep those ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 890, Start: 890, Overview: it but wash watch the mics wash them and make sure that you keep you keep those those Dynamic ones close um now the angle is really important too uh make sure that you are reducing the amount of those very poppy sounds um you know uh and then the pop filter again is going to help with those different like ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 911, Start: 911, Overview: know uh and then the pop filter again is going to help with those different like noises that are coming across that are like when you're when you're saying P's and B's they really pop into the mic in a different way um and we call those plosives and we'll dig into a little bit ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 926, Start: 926, Overview: different way um and we call those plosives and we'll dig into a little bit of that in in a bit um but those plosives and those shocking moments kind of shock the system a little bit for people where um people can't really handle the vibration or the noise that's kind of happening and so they'll kind of ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 940, Start: 940, Overview: handle the vibration or the noise that's kind of happening and so they'll kind of move on to the next uh video so you know if you want to keep people engaged um having the ability to understand the different Dynamics in which you are recording with your mic is important now the lab year clip I mean that's usually ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 955, Start: 955, Overview: recording with your mic is important now the lab year clip I mean that's usually attached to you know up here close close to the close to the mouth close to the neck close somewhere on the shirt um and that's because again that's a little bit more self prescribed um audio device it ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 972, Start: 972, Overview: more self prescribed um audio device it really is picking up just what who you are what you're saying it's not picking up any background whatsoever so it needs to be as close to you as possible but not too close because again it's it's like a condenser so it's picking up ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 716, Start: 716, Overview: ways or was whichever you prefer all right and um there's only a few shapes left here so let's do that quickly and then we're going to go to image trace and see how that works for us um I'll show you some of the options that you have because your sketches may look different and this is just one project ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 728, Start: 728, Overview: have because your sketches may look different and this is just one project right so your sketches may look different than mine and I think it's important to know the various ways that you can actually vectorize your sketches sometimes maybe you like already had something that was brilliant and you ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 740, Start: 740, Overview: sometimes maybe you like already had something that was brilliant and you just wanted Like A variation of that in illustrator I've had those times when I treated something in ad doie Fresco and I just wanted to see how that looked in vectors um all right and maybe now that we are here maybe I'll show you how I ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 753, Start: 753, Overview: vectors um all right and maybe now that we are here maybe I'll show you how I use the curvature pen tool which is like right over here you can actually add points here and add like some Dimension which I really like I'm going to do that to some of these here just so that the stems are like extended um I really love ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 767, Start: 767, Overview: to some of these here just so that the stems are like extended um I really love how you can do that here super easy click and drag so click on this and drag it out super easy don't even have to think about it maybe I can do it with this guy here too and that just gives it that natural shape right I love that ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 783, Start: 783, Overview: this guy here too and that just gives it that natural shape right I love that okay and um all right let's dive into this super quickly um I'm going to make this cool and okay so I'm just going to make use of the direct selection tool here so I can do this really really quick all ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 800, Start: 800, Overview: use of the direct selection tool here so I can do this really really quick all right um a on the key keyboard and then you can drag your cursor over the points that you want to use and just like make them like this that was cool that was cool okay I feel like there are two points here so I'm going ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 818, Start: 818, Overview: cool that was cool okay I feel like there are two points here so I'm going to press P that was not the case but no worries we can press the direct selection and then extend this point here and that's it and then press L on the keyboard maybe make this white and then maybe you want to bring in ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 832, Start: 832, Overview: L on the keyboard maybe make this white and then maybe you want to bring in color now so here are all the colors that I made all the color palettes that I had but let's create um let's bring in the sketch over here at the bottom and then maybe we want to use image Trace so where's image Trace image Trace sits ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 847, Start: 847, Overview: then maybe we want to use image Trace so where's image Trace image Trace sits here at the top click on image trace and it says this is a large image I can size it down maybe let's do that actually let's keep it large because I want to compare it to the shapes that I made click okay and it's already image ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 886, Start: 886, Overview: really well I think I really love that um I do want to increase the threshold a little bit so it gets more points in the picture and this is actually super cool you didn't actually have to use the pen tool but I wanted to add my personal touch to it I can click on ignore color if it has any color in this case it ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 898, Start: 898, Overview: touch to it I can click on ignore color if it has any color in this case it doesn't so it's just going to stay as is you can increase the noise and the corners that you have and decrease the parts that you have so look carefully um here I'm going to zoom in a little bit just to show you and I'm going to ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 1048, Start: 1048, Overview: I think I want this color here maybe I want this to be yellow yeah I think that looks cool and then we can just like bring the shape down here rotate it um and then turn it around so go to properties transform and then maybe like rotate it again yeah that looks cool and then ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1061, Start: 1061, Overview: rotate it again yeah that looks cool and then maybe make it bigger all right all right this is coming together I do actually love that um maybe I want this color here and then let's make one of these shapes as well let's go to m make this shape ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1075, Start: 1075, Overview: shapes as well let's go to m make this shape here um you can make this Leaf like multiple ways I feel like that's one of the ways that I make the leaves but there is like a very cool way to make a symmetric Leaf as well that I actually want to show you so if you press M on ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1090, Start: 1090, Overview: symmetric Leaf as well that I actually want to show you so if you press M on your keyboard and make like a square here I will take these two points with a direct selection and just bring it in and that's like a really cool Leaf shape I think that is super cool and you can just like use that um that is one way if ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 1118, Start: 1118, Overview: and then I'm going to press this on my keyboard press command J to like make these points here maybe I want like circles in here so we'll see let's let's bring it together and maybe I want this to be like yellow ooh that color looks so good I love it pressing command D to make copies now ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1131, Start: 1131, Overview: so good I love it pressing command D to make copies now this is actually like slightly bigger so I bring it down and that actually looks brilliant and I'm I can either go to the Pathfinder to like create a compound shape which let's do it in this case and that looks good that actually looks ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1146, Start: 1146, Overview: shape which let's do it in this case and that looks good that actually looks brilliant and now we're only left with like two shapes but maybe for the sake of time I want to bring it here like so and maybe make it like this color maybe size it down just like a little bit here and then we're only left for two shapes ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1159, Start: 1159, Overview: size it down just like a little bit here and then we're only left for two shapes and five more minutes so we can actually get started here really quickly so let me make this like slightly um easier for your eyes so not too much red and then I'm going to press command C command F and then size it down um press this ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 1266, Start: 1266, Overview: use it so select all the shapes here and in this contextual tossb bar you see recolor click on recolor and this is where the generative recolor panel comes in click on generative recolor and you have sample prompts here that you can scroll to and see if you like anything let's actually go with salmon sushi and ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1280, Start: 1280, Overview: scroll to and see if you like anything let's actually go with salmon sushi and see what it generates for us just to see what works and if it works for our color palette I think we could use like a summer kind of wipe that would ooh these are generating I actually love this this is so like Pally um let's actually ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1293, Start: 1293, Overview: are generating I actually love this this is so like Pally um let's actually generate more and see how that looks and we can make like as many variations as we want with generative recolor and this kind of like gives you a perspective where you never thought that you would use these colors this is a nice monotone ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1307, Start: 1307, Overview: where you never thought that you would use these colors this is a nice monotone green and you never thought you'd use these colors in your color palette and you still do because it generated it for this is actually so cool it has like the warmth of things and I love this one so let's ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1319, Start: 1319, Overview: actually so cool it has like the warmth of things and I love this one so let's actually stick to this one we started with this I'm going to turn off my sketch layer here we started with this um let me started with this color palette and ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1331, Start: 1331, Overview: um let me started with this color palette and now we're here and I think I'm want to generate like a couple more so why don't we create a new art board here and then I'm going to make two more here so let's generate like a few more here maybe like experiment with how you think things ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1349, Start: 1349, Overview: generate like a few more here maybe like experiment with how you think things look like so maybe I say summer Island um pastel I don't know let's do that and click on generate and see what comes up I think this is going to look really nice and we'll end with like using ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1366, Start: 1366, Overview: I think this is going to look really nice and we'll end with like using repeat grids to make patterns which is going to be super cool all right this is not what I expected um but we'll see we'll see how that goes sometimes you have like make some more iterations for having the perfect values that you ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1378, Start: 1378, Overview: have like make some more iterations for having the perfect values that you wanted I think this these colors go well together but it's just not the vibe I was going for um maybe my maybe I need to Lear on work on my let's say bubblegum bubblegum Forest I don't know how I ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1391, Start: 1391, Overview: bubblegum bubblegum Forest I don't know how I don't know what that's going to generate but in my brain it's like greens and pinks and I think that might be fun but we'll see what that generates so I think the moral of the story here is just have fun with it while you're using generat ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1404, Start: 1404, Overview: the moral of the story here is just have fun with it while you're using generat recolor I think it's really important to like just have fun wow that is brilliant that is something that I had in my brain and that actually looks perfect um I don't know why this is a different color oh maybe because I didn't change the ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1417, Start: 1417, Overview: don't know why this is a different color oh maybe because I didn't change the color of that from Gray that's probably why and that makes sense um I didn't actually change the color from Gray so yeah that makes sense it's still gray over here so that's why I was like oh this color does not exist in this color ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1428, Start: 1428, Overview: over here so that's why I was like oh this color does not exist in this color palette that you have so let me just give it some random color and I think that looks cool I think I want to make um um let's actually delete these because I want to make a pattern of this so let let us copy um some of these ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 1452, Start: 1452, Overview: is just grouping these elements and maybe I want to size it down just to like fit it on my screen here now there are various ways to make patterns and this was not in our plan for today but just as a bonus content I feel like maybe we should do something like that so have your object selected here go to ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1464, Start: 1464, Overview: maybe we should do something like that so have your object selected here go to object go to repeat and go to grid I think you can Al you can also do pattern if you wanted to make a pattern for like adding it to your packaging or something but I think I just want to experiment with how this is going to look like ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1478, Start: 1478, Overview: but I think I just want to experiment with how this is going to look like maybe on a wallpaper or something and just to get get a visual of how that's going to look I prefer going to repeat and creating a repeat grid that looks awesome I think this is a great start of like seeing how it ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1488, Start: 1488, Overview: grid that looks awesome I think this is a great start of like seeing how it would look on packaging design or maybe even like a box and um I think the key thing about patterns is knowing that it's a pattern but it's still not a pattern you know what I mean like right now you can see variations and like see ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1503, Start: 1503, Overview: pattern you know what I mean like right now you can see variations and like see where the things are repeating like this ways is like super evident but the good thing about repeat grids is that you have repeat options this is where you can change the spacing the grid type flip rows or flip columns let's go ahead ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 28, Start: 28, Overview: Photoshop and we're going to get get to explore something different every week so I'm excited to take on this journey with y'all and today we're going to be exploring how to create a collage collage is a very special art form in my opinion that can really translate differently when you step into a digital ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 43, Start: 43, Overview: opinion that can really translate differently when you step into a digital space and I say that because a lot of collaging evolved from analog right like tearing up paper tearing up pictures and I found myself doing something of the likes just to try to understand this medium a little bit better so we're ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 61, Start: 61, Overview: likes just to try to understand this medium a little bit better so we're going to learn how to approach this collaging art form here on Photoshop with some different techniques so I'm excited to jump in so open up your Photoshop and let's Jump Right In and explore all right so as we are here in ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 75, Start: 75, Overview: Photoshop and let's Jump Right In and explore all right so as we are here in my desktop right we also have right before us a interesting goodie that you are going to get for free here on this challenge because you got to give to get right and this is how it works so I love this because these are some of my ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 97, Start: 97, Overview: right and this is how it works so I love this because these are some of my favorite prompts that I've been able to kind of just uh craft and I would love for you to try them on your own because part of how we're going to approach collaging today is going to be by generating AI images or what I like to ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 113, Start: 113, Overview: collaging today is going to be by generating AI images or what I like to call ingredi ingredients that we'll introduce into our collaging so try some of these prompts yourself and see what you get and hopefully this inspires you to start something really interesting Dynamic and hopefully a little bit ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 128, Start: 128, Overview: to start something really interesting Dynamic and hopefully a little bit surreal right of your own so let's go into Photoshop and I'm going to be in Photoshop beta I am definitely testing Photoshop and Photoshop beta quite frequently and right now I find myself ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 144, Start: 144, Overview: Photoshop and Photoshop beta quite frequently and right now I find myself in photo sh beta just exploring all the new features all the time so here we are um you can always open up this file in Photoshop just as well by the way there's no no no funky workflow there so what we're going to be creating today is ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 159, Start: 159, Overview: there's no no no funky workflow there so what we're going to be creating today is going to be something like this or an iteration of this in reality because it's not um going to always generate the same thing right because a lot of these elements were AI generated so I I'll leave it up to you to guess which were ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 176, Start: 176, Overview: elements were AI generated so I I'll leave it up to you to guess which were generated AI because some of them are going to surprise you I say so I'm going to show you how I built this let's dive right into it and we're going to talk about how we're going to get all of these different ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 197, Start: 197, Overview: and we're going to talk about how we're going to get all of these different Dynamic variations Isn't that cool all right so let's get started here um okay so we have here a setup I've set this up in the style in which I think it's going to be best for me to start building this ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 217, Start: 217, Overview: the style in which I think it's going to be best for me to start building this collage so I have some portraits here that I've chosen and I've chosen them specifically into different scales and I've already turned them black and white you can do that by going into image adjustment black and white which ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 232, Start: 232, Overview: you can do that by going into image adjustment black and white which also has a shortcut by the way or shift command you if you don't worry about what kind of black and white there's very many variations so now I have two different images that are going to be more or less my hero images right you ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 250, Start: 250, Overview: different images that are going to be more or less my hero images right you want two hero images of some of sorts so you've got this one and you've got a smaller version that's going to be important whichever one you choose now I have my contextual bar here and what I love about it is that it understands ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 264, Start: 264, Overview: have my contextual bar here and what I love about it is that it understands that these are some some of the steps that I may take next because I'm sitting on a rized file which could be maybe I want to select the subject maybe I want to remove a background and in fact it's right I want to remove the background of ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 279, Start: 279, Overview: to remove a background and in fact it's right I want to remove the background of this subject or I can select it as well but if you find yourself looking at this and it looks different that is because that bar is called the contextual Bar for a reason it moves in the context of whatever you're working on and that's ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 296, Start: 296, Overview: for a reason it moves in the context of whatever you're working on and that's going to generate different uh remarks basically that are going to prompt you to do a different action so here it tells me if I want to generate a background which in fact I can or if I want to import an image and all of these ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 311, Start: 311, Overview: background which in fact I can or if I want to import an image and all of these different variations so pay attention to that because that's really cool to uh become familiar with so as I'm here I'm going to uh increase this right about there and ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 325, Start: 325, Overview: to uh increase this right about there and decrease this and put it in the foreground and I think I'm going to also flip it horizontally so it's facing outwards when you flip something horizontally just watch out there's no text or type that just became completely ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 341, Start: 341, Overview: horizontally just watch out there's no text or type that just became completely illegible illegible once you turned it or flipped it so you can see here there's some areas that didn't go so well in this T tid bit so what's okay okay about this is this process is that you're able to always access that ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 359, Start: 359, Overview: okay about this is this process is that you're able to always access that mask so I can bring back some of the detail or information without having to worry that I'm going to lose all that information once it removed my background it removes the background but it kind of stores it safely away right ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 375, Start: 375, Overview: background it removes the background but it kind of stores it safely away right so I might want to do something like this to just bring back those areas I want using the color white right so that's the way I'm going to go about it and I can also revise any other areas that don't work for me so ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 392, Start: 392, Overview: to go about it and I can also revise any other areas that don't work for me so holding alt or option there it's going to give you that U visibility so now my thumb is back awesome it's nice to have a a thumb back so I'm going to play around with these a little bit and add some funky effects here I'm going to add ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 408, Start: 408, Overview: around with these a little bit and add some funky effects here I'm going to add a sort of cutout element because we're navigating how this would be if it was an analog image right like if I had actually copied and pasted this or cut this out out of a magazine so I'm going to make this ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 430, Start: 430, Overview: this out out of a magazine so I'm going to make this selection it it made a shape for me which I don't actually need um and I'm going to fill that mask in that area with block so it removes it but it's only going to store it safely as we said before so when it comes to this area I ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 446, Start: 446, Overview: only going to store it safely as we said before so when it comes to this area I want to pretend it's Hollow right like there's there's some kind of whimsicle to it and it has a shape of its own has kind of this thing going on we don't want to go to over maybe something like that and I think here is actually a good ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 464, Start: 464, Overview: want to go to over maybe something like that and I think here is actually a good opportunity to reshape that selection that you made to so maybe like [Music] this right about there okay I'm going to leave that there I think yes and I'm ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 482, Start: 482, Overview: this right about there okay I'm going to leave that there I think yes and I'm going to change that color to maybe something more vibrant maybe a yellow and hit that backspace and now we've got that effect in there I can make it a little bit smaller right and of course detail ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 500, Start: 500, Overview: make it a little bit smaller right and of course detail oriented um steps here for sure so so I got that cool effect and I can do it one more time here hitting the P again to I'm going to sacrifice this this um this bracelet here and just just um I'm sorry I love that ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 521, Start: 521, Overview: um this bracelet here and just just um I'm sorry I love that bracelet but it's got to go today because I want even space between the selections and doing the same thing I'm going to fill that with black and again I'm going to create a shape that makes it appear like it's Hollow and so that's ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 537, Start: 537, Overview: I'm going to create a shape that makes it appear like it's Hollow and so that's going to be with the pen tool I love using the pen tool and I'm going to make this maybe a different color right we can try a different color for this one um oh didn't I select a different color you were there you saw ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 555, Start: 555, Overview: one um oh didn't I select a different color you were there you saw me okay so command backspace and voila we got this kind of cutout effect in it and that looks so much better so now something I wanted to show you about that cutout effect and how we can translate that over in my ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 576, Start: 576, Overview: show you about that cutout effect and how we can translate that over in my experimentation of collaging I found myself also exploring things like this I wanted to show you this collaging because it is in essence how collaging was born you really just cut out the different pieces and create these Hollow ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 597, Start: 597, Overview: was born you really just cut out the different pieces and create these Hollow spaces these negative spaces that can go over just about anything and they can be really really fun to play with right so I put it over this print here and it was fun because my wife and I were uh playing around with collaging at at a ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 617, Start: 617, Overview: fun because my wife and I were uh playing around with collaging at at a point here because it's got really fun and she picked this copy right here that says shift your outlook and so that's nice because that's our type element of our design when I put this together I really had to ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 632, Start: 632, Overview: that's our type element of our design when I put this together I really had to think about scale here too because as in this process it's a little bit different because we have to cut out and decisively pick our ingredients um and that is going to then be redefined by our layout because I can ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 647, Start: 647, Overview: ingredients um and that is going to then be redefined by our layout because I can easily put this instead in the center and this becomes a far brand new artwork right so it gives you a different sense of appreciation for collaging in a different way so if I move on back to much easier grounds ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 669, Start: 669, Overview: for collaging in a different way so if I move on back to much easier grounds which is going to be our Photoshop space you're going to see that here we're able to make those cutouts so much simpler we don't have to worry about Selec the ingredients that we don't want and not having other options ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 688, Start: 688, Overview: about Selec the ingredients that we don't want and not having other options and what I mean by that is if we move away from portraits now we're going to start to have to build this environment so I love in collaging I love exploring a base where my Center focus is going to be be in and an environment so we're ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 704, Start: 704, Overview: a base where my Center focus is going to be be in and an environment so we're going to build that up with generative fill things that we can't do in paper collaging which is quite wonderful to explore right so under here those are my textures by the way which we will talk about so under here what I could do is I ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 723, Start: 723, Overview: textures by the way which we will talk about so under here what I could do is I can select an area to start adding elements to but I don't want this to give me any in uh contextual generation what I mean by that is I don't want it to use that as it generates um I don't want it to use it as information so I ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 741, Start: 741, Overview: to use that as it generates um I don't want it to use it as information so I rather use a blind ch so I turned off the other ones and I'm going to generate clouds here and that's it that's all I will be generating in this one and what's really peculiar about this process is that when it comes to ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 758, Start: 758, Overview: what's really peculiar about this process is that when it comes to generative fill anything can happen we can be generating just about anything you give it a small guide but then it can create a variation of that that is different every time right so I love being able to do that though because ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 771, Start: 771, Overview: different every time right so I love being able to do that though because that leaves it for a lot of um a lot of room for uh spontaneity and if that word and I think it's super cool to explore so I've got this layer here that got generated without being influenced by my work and now I can bring it over maybe ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 790, Start: 790, Overview: generated without being influenced by my work and now I can bring it over maybe down here and delete this mask it comes with a mask but we don't need it add black bring back our background and our portraits and start Brushing in that at Cloud so we're basically like hanging out in a cloud of sorts right so ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 808, Start: 808, Overview: that at Cloud so we're basically like hanging out in a cloud of sorts right so we're going to do something like this and ideally I think it's best if you generate a cloud on black um or a cloud yeah a cloud on black so basically all the white clouds on a black ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 825, Start: 825, Overview: cloud yeah a cloud on black so basically all the white clouds on a black background that's going to be cool because it's going to blend better with all of your the rest of your assets but here you know this blue is not looking too bad I got to say but I'm able to bring those clouds in in a subtly ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 839, Start: 839, Overview: too bad I got to say but I'm able to bring those clouds in in a subtly natural way where it just sort of Fades here on the edges awesome and if you are trying it in Photoshop yourself let me know how what kind of cloud did you get if you know your clouds No let me see here let ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 862, Start: 862, Overview: what kind of cloud did you get if you know your clouds No let me see here let mebe remove that a little bit so I'm just toggling between black and white shift X to toggle and then also um just making sure that I'm painting The Mask not my artwork and that's going to be cool but what's ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 879, Start: 879, Overview: painting The Mask not my artwork and that's going to be cool but what's interesting here that we don't get in paper collaging is going to be this right here so this is telling me it's still a generative fill file so essentially I can still generate other types of clouds so I can still write ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 894, Start: 894, Overview: essentially I can still generate other types of clouds so I can still write here on black background and let that create a new variation my mask will still be the mask it may be a good fit for this new generation it may not be but what so interesting is that we're able to create ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 912, Start: 912, Overview: generation it may not be but what so interesting is that we're able to create Dynamic elements okay so it went with a kind of Illustrated black cloud not what I was hoping for at all but I can still create different variations right like if I just I'm just going to generate clouds there because I ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 929, Start: 929, Overview: variations right like if I just I'm just going to generate clouds there because I think the blue is just fine but you want to create at least three different Generations I find that in the third generation it often creates something different it might be you can see what I'm saying ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 942, Start: 942, Overview: different it might be you can see what I'm saying by this Cloud right here I'm just going to investigate this really quick with you I'm going to disabled this layer mask This Cloud is being influenced by this environment and that's kind of what I meant by when I generated the cloud on ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 957, Start: 957, Overview: this environment and that's kind of what I meant by when I generated the cloud on its own without having the influence of the background this is what would have happened otherwise so let's undo all those that's what's happening as I'm talking to you I'm discovering that and it's so interesting to navigate so just ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 972, Start: 972, Overview: talking to you I'm discovering that and it's so interesting to navigate so just know that as you generate you might want to generate on white to be able to not have too strong of an influence on your generation so I think I'm going to go back to the first one here go back to properties Windows ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 986, Start: 986, Overview: back to the first one here go back to properties Windows properties um there you are okay so in Windows properties I've got my clouds I think I like those best and in here I'm going to continue generating elements ingredients as I like to call them and so I'm going to same as before delete ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1005, Start: 1005, Overview: ingredients as I like to call them and so I'm going to same as before delete some of these not delete turn them off with the eye and now that I've created clouds now the next one is plants or foliage so in here I can just select everything command a and I'm going to say ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1022, Start: 1022, Overview: everything command a and I'm going to say a uh tropical plants leaves floating so let's do that let's see what we get here I want to create different variations of the background and always ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1039, Start: 1039, Overview: we get here I want to create different variations of the background and always read this copy here because it says only select what you want to change to be able to influence it absolutely agree so you can see all these are the variations that we got so these are good candidates for creating texture the texture that ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1056, Start: 1056, Overview: that we got so these are good candidates for creating texture the texture that you saw earlier to vary Your Design fairly quickly and I'll show you in a little bit how how we can do that so as we generate a few more here I can say on a black background which I forgot to do background I've gotten fast faster at ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1072, Start: 1072, Overview: a black background which I forgot to do background I've gotten fast faster at typing folks because of this which is so funny it's true it's absolutely true so we got now two variations and we're going to some candidates for um texture for sure but I also want some independent ones so these ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1090, Start: 1090, Overview: candidates for um texture for sure but I also want some independent ones so these are good independent ones I think so if I was to use maybe um I don't know why it's on the border but it kind of looks like something that could work with us so if we got CL CLS here let's generate one more thing before we use that and we ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1107, Start: 1107, Overview: so if we got CL CLS here let's generate one more thing before we use that and we wanted to create a moon for this Moon I can actually Ed Say Hey I want a circular element so I might select only a circle and call it Moon uh on black background you can start to see there's a pattern here right um so I'm going to ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1127, Start: 1127, Overview: background you can start to see there's a pattern here right um so I'm going to let that run and generate a moon hopefully a full moon cuz I did not write that oh okay so we got some variations of moons here um okay that one looks like a good candidate for us so we've got our moon we got our foliage ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1145, Start: 1145, Overview: one looks like a good candidate for us so we've got our moon we got our foliage we've got our clouds and I think I wanted to create some birds so what if we do that by just creating selecting a spot a smaller spot I'm going to say and create Birds line fing in Black ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1165, Start: 1165, Overview: create Birds line fing in Black Background birds flying birds flying group of birds I'll write a group of birds there you go and it also tells me here to remove the content try generating without a prompt so you don't always have to write a prompt in this ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 589, Start: 589, Overview: this is because once it is turned into a symbol as you can see it has that plus sign in the middle and then you cannot change its color you cannot change it it's going to stay like this so that's why it's good to have everything else as a backup and whatever happens outside of the artboard stays outside the artboard ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 607, Start: 607, Overview: a backup and whatever happens outside of the artboard stays outside the artboard so it's totally okay if it gets messy okay so again putting this on this side if you wanted right away actually let's make another symbol so then we can explore what this is going to to look ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 335, Start: 335, Overview: this to become it an object right I would just group it because or else all of the circles are individual and that can become very messy so let's make sure that everything here is selected and I'm going to do command G to group it now I want to show you what it does but using the rectangle because it also ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 432, Start: 432, Overview: because it's not reacting the same as the ellips or the rectangle I think it's because instead of starting to a point you know where the rectangle if I go back here when we start when it when we start here it starts from a corner and when we have the the star tool it actually starts from the center so it's ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 450, Start: 450, Overview: and when we have the the star tool it actually starts from the center so it's going to react a little differently for that effect but it's still really cool so if we use this and again holding onto the tile key see what it's doing I mean how cool is that and there ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 467, Start: 467, Overview: key see what it's doing I mean how cool is that and there is so much that we can do with this I'm just going again and group this all right I mean if we look at this if we look at all of the shapes together my favorite is definitely the ellipse one so I'm going to work with it but I ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 523, Start: 523, Overview: so and again go nuts cuz this is not something that is calculated there's a lot of designs that needs to be calculated and for this specific function it doesn't have to which is great so we have this I want to have just something that's like maybe ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 142, Start: 142, Overview: so one of the things you can do is you can use your history brush you can undo and redo it with a better selection but you can also use the history brush to kind of just brush in and that's kind of undo on a brush so where I kind of like a a little carried away with the selection I can just undo those and get ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 157, Start: 157, Overview: a a little carried away with the selection I can just undo those and get rid of them there all right so and if I didn't get rid of them good enough I can also use the remove tool to remove I see a little element of one there let go let that one go and I see a little one there as well ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 172, Start: 172, Overview: that one go and I see a little one there as well we'll let that one go too oh hang on again because I'm on that layer might just be easier to do select and delete because it's trying to bring in when I do that remove tool is trying to bring in surrounding pixels and ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 198, Start: 198, Overview: the way and let's see if this works yep that worked fine all right so sometimes it's the simple methods that work best so now we'll go ahead and save that and I don't know you may see it update behind in real time the next time I go back since I did update the actual live graphic all right so now we'll head back ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 298, Start: 298, Overview: yellow so that was a good one to do however if I go to this next one in this next one uh the problem with this particular one is that uh the the soft box is coming in over her head and it's really close to her like it's really close to her fingers it's really close to her hair so forth and so on so if I ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 377, Start: 377, Overview: back to uh all the settings are reset from where it was last pulled in and this is the one I probably want that one yes no any of these should be good all right we'll use that one all right so let's go to that one and now we'll use command e and we'll open that up in Photoshop so ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 395, Start: 395, Overview: to that one and now we'll use command e and we'll open that up in Photoshop so Photoshop can be opened up from Lightroom classic with command e or contr E on Windows and in um in your uh Lightroom it would be command shift e so it's a additional shift key to do it so let's see if I can ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 413, Start: 413, Overview: command shift e so it's a additional shift key to do it so let's see if I can get this one open open just want to make sure I'm doing this right whoa whoa whoa there we go edit in Photoshop and we'll give it a second to do ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 429, Start: 429, Overview: Photoshop and we'll give it a second to do that looks like it's working there we go all right so now we're in Photoshop with that image and it's pulling that image from my Nas so that's why it takes a few seconds to do these now in this particular example um ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 442, Start: 442, Overview: that's why it takes a few seconds to do these now in this particular example um but here we are we're in this particular uh image and there's our our uh our big softbox there Shadow and I can use a variety of tools so when something's not working for you in a Lightroom that's when it's time to think about going over ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 460, Start: 460, Overview: working for you in a Lightroom that's when it's time to think about going over to photoshop and it it's because Photoshop has a dozen ways to remove this whereas Lightroom may have two or three so it it's just if something works in Lightroom classic or Lightroom great consider yourself fortunate that it was ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 478, Start: 478, Overview: in Lightroom classic or Lightroom great consider yourself fortunate that it was simple enough to use those tools to do it if it's a little bit more complex that's when you head over to photoshop because Photoshop has more options more more tools to do it now Photoshop has a brand new remove tool as well and this ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 490, Start: 490, Overview: more tools to do it now Photoshop has a brand new remove tool as well and this one is AI based and if I make my brush a little bit bigger here in Photoshop I can just go ahead and now I'm going to get instead of an outline I'm going to get a purple kind of a pinkish purple out or overlay and now even though it's ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 503, Start: 503, Overview: get a purple kind of a pinkish purple out or overlay and now even though it's a same Shadow same still close to her hair because it uses AI it's a little smarter in figuring out what it should do so it did leave a little bit but that's okay we just go ahead and say nope you left some go ahead and take ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 518, Start: 518, Overview: that's okay we just go ahead and say nope you left some go ahead and take that out and it's a much better distraction removal so with that said um you can certainly go in and try and do it in multiple passes in Lightroom or Lightroom classic but sometimes it's just easier to do it quicker and ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 532, Start: 532, Overview: Lightroom classic but sometimes it's just easier to do it quicker and probably better with less stress than to just go ahead and do it right there in Photoshop and know that it's going to do a better job all right so that's one uh let's go to another one here uh I like this example because this example ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 225, Start: 225, Overview: sort of guidelines of what I'm looking for when I'm shooting a montage like this the important thing is you want to have a variety of your shots you want to have establishing shots maybe a wide shot you want to let's cut back to me real quick you want to be able to have you know a variety of different shots ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 237, Start: 237, Overview: real quick you want to be able to have you know a variety of different shots you want to have those establishing shots some tight shots really create the story in a compelling way and that only that not only looks I think just visually better uh than every shot being exactly the same but it helps to guide ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 248, Start: 248, Overview: visually better uh than every shot being exactly the same but it helps to guide the viewer Along on a bit of a narrative and it's just visually more interesting to watch so let's play this back and this is again this is like my base morning routine uh and in this case I filmed it for you to uh to see what we ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 261, Start: 261, Overview: morning routine uh and in this case I filmed it for you to uh to see what we got going on here so let's just play that back all right for some reason one second we are going to cut back let's cut back to our Premier here ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 273, Start: 273, Overview: reason one second we are going to cut back let's cut back to our Premier here we go now we're inside a Premiere Pro all right awesome so lots of different things going on in here uh lots of different cuts and as you can see I don't have any actual audio other than ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 310, Start: 310, Overview: different cuts and as you can see I don't have any actual audio other than the sound that is recorded uh on the camera there's a couple little sound effects that we're going to go into in a minute here but the couple things I do want to point out here let's just mute this track is we're starting on ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 319, Start: 319, Overview: want to point out here let's just mute this track is we're starting on something that's this like wide establishing shot so in this case uh you just get creative with it you know there's no dictation on how you're supposed to shoot something like this this is really ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 330, Start: 330, Overview: dictation on how you're supposed to shoot something like this this is really just for fun it's a a good experimental way to uh get better at your craft to learn the ins and outs of framing lighting uh cinematography all those kind of things and I really sometimes like those refrigerator shots I think ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 342, Start: 342, Overview: kind of things and I really sometimes like those refrigerator shots I think they they look pretty cool they Captivate the audience really quickly so the first thing we have here is we have this shot of me opening the refrigerator and most of these shots if you look back again let's mute this as well everything ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 354, Start: 354, Overview: and most of these shots if you look back again let's mute this as well everything is static and on a tripod okay so when you're shooting by yourself when you're shooting alone that's one of the things that uh can become a challenge you want to be able to set things up on a tripod so that you create the action yourself ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 369, Start: 369, Overview: to be able to set things up on a tripod so that you create the action yourself and to create match cuts and to create transitions that way you have to be a little bit more creative so if we look at this shot right here this is me you know just filling up this Kettle in the sink so let's just go into our audio ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 382, Start: 382, Overview: know just filling up this Kettle in the sink so let's just go into our audio mixer really quickly we're going to hop into audio we're going to go into our clip mixer and I'm going to just take the track down a little bit just so that we're not blowing everyone's ears out here on the ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 393, Start: 393, Overview: down a little bit just so that we're not blowing everyone's ears out here on the stream all right so what I did here is we have our clip of me filling the uh Kettle here and then what I did is I actually wiped that kettle over the frame and what that allows me to do then is have another shot on the second shot ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 407, Start: 407, Overview: frame and what that allows me to do then is have another shot on the second shot here where I'm also starting on something in front of the lens so if I open this clip up we're going to go back into our edit panel here uh let's see this reveal this in Project all right and if we double click ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 421, Start: 421, Overview: here uh let's see this reveal this in Project all right and if we double click this you can actually see that I started this clip right up here on the lens right so if I go frame by frame now we've dropped our tortillas out of the frame so from ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 438, Start: 438, Overview: our tortillas out of the frame so from here to there okay and what that allows me to do is create what's called a match cut or in this case it's sort of like a transitional cut so I can go and let's just bring this into its own sequence so we're going to go 1920 by 1080 let's ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 454, Start: 454, Overview: just bring this into its own sequence so we're going to go 1920 by 1080 let's just create this and call this Challenge three all right and what I'm going to do is I'm just going to go back into my project panel here um so we can look at the footage together and I'm going to go from that ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 506, Start: 506, Overview: this the intention in mind that I want to wipe that shot and then end up in another shot so it looks like there's a transition but I'm doing all of those transitions in camera all right so if I go here I'm going to cut that clip command K is how I is how I set up my shortcut all right and then what we're ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 532, Start: 532, Overview: something that I sort of plan out when I'm thinking about okay how can I create something visually uh appealing between these two two clips and make it look like there's almost like magic involved and really there's a there's so many simple ways to do it different ways to do it um and I love finding kind of ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 544, Start: 544, Overview: simple ways to do it different ways to do it um and I love finding kind of unique creative ways to create those transitions when you're just shooting alone so we're going to take this clip here where I start on my my black tortilla there maybe we want to set an inpoint and an outp point and ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 557, Start: 557, Overview: my my black tortilla there maybe we want to set an inpoint and an outp point and drag this in all right so now if we look at these two clips together and we play that back kind of in real time you can kind of see that we've created our own little transition just by me wiping the kettle and then ending on this but I ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 571, Start: 571, Overview: little transition just by me wiping the kettle and then ending on this but I want to move this up a little bit more so it's still moving command k w is going to be my ripple delete and now we have something that's pretty cool just from Kettle in the sink and this shot of you know the tortillas ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 583, Start: 583, Overview: pretty cool just from Kettle in the sink and this shot of you know the tortillas Landing okay and all I really did there they're both tripod shots they're both sort of a wide shot and I just thought ahead based on my shot list of how do I make these things kind of come together in a really interesting way all right so ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 598, Start: 598, Overview: make these things kind of come together in a really interesting way all right so that's one example that we have inside of this video another example I want to break down and again this is today all about shooting the mundane things some things that may not really be that exciting on its face and creatively ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 610, Start: 610, Overview: things that may not really be that exciting on its face and creatively finding a way to make them uh engaging and make them visually interesting all right so the second thing I want to break down here is uh this is a true match cut where I'm using like shapes in my videos to create the effect that I'm ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 622, Start: 622, Overview: match cut where I'm using like shapes in my videos to create the effect that I'm cutting from like one one similar frame to another all right I'm going to mute this real quick again so we don't blow out my eardrums and we're going to just play this little section here for a second all right so let's play from ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 634, Start: 634, Overview: play this little section here for a second all right so let's play from here all right so you see this right here this egg shot this is if I turn on my safe margins which I always like to keep these on when I'm creating specific match cuts and the reason being is over here I have my guides if you do not see ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 650, Start: 650, Overview: match cuts and the reason being is over here I have my guides if you do not see your guides go to your button editor window and these are going to be all these little buttons that may not show up in your default editing settings and then you just drag this on to your actual toolbar so these are like the ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 661, Start: 661, Overview: then you just drag this on to your actual toolbar so these are like the most used tools that you might use I have my Loop playback here as well all right so what you can see is I've actually scaled this uh carton down or this shot down if I go to my effects controls you'll see that I have scaled ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 673, Start: 673, Overview: this shot down if I go to my effects controls you'll see that I have scaled that into about 160% instead of what this was initially all right and the reason I did that is because I noticed in film in putting these two things together that we have these like round shapes okay like round frame we're ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 685, Start: 685, Overview: together that we have these like round shapes okay like round frame we're shooting from the top down in both of them so why not try to line those like rounded spots up so we're basically creating this really cool match cut between the two so if I just scroll back and forth we have that round of the ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 698, Start: 698, Overview: between the two so if I just scroll back and forth we have that round of the coffee beans we have the round coffee beans themselves and here we have that really cool nice circle of the eggs all right and so to spice that up a little bit more what we did is we came in here and we started even uh more scaled in so ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 708, Start: 708, Overview: bit more what we did is we came in here and we started even uh more scaled in so we create this really visually sort of uh quick cinematic cut so that we end here on the round egg as it opens and then we go right into that uh Coffee Bean uh as well all right so lots of cool ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 773, Start: 773, Overview: is a third little hack or transitional uh tip inside of premere pro and that is called a jcut or an L cut okay and so if we turn this mute button off we drag this up a little bit whoops whoops whoops whoops we have a uh sound effect that I put in of just some standard like coffee ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 804, Start: 804, Overview: right here inside of Premiere Pro using some of the Adobe Stock features but you got got to find something that does feel a little bit realistic it feels like the one you would have recorded now I could have just gone back and recorded that over again with my audio but uh time is money and I didn't really have that time ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 814, Start: 814, Overview: over again with my audio but uh time is money and I didn't really have that time okay so what I did is I added this little sound effect here I dragged the volume down we used these new handles that we have here inside of Premiere Pro and what I did is I dragged this audio out underneath the previous clip all ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 827, Start: 827, Overview: and what I did is I dragged this audio out underneath the previous clip all right so that I'm creating that anticipation for the next clip it happens really really quickly and it happens fast however if I turn this off you can already hear that sound effect coming in so it's anticipating ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 844, Start: 844, Overview: off you can already hear that sound effect coming in so it's anticipating the next cut that's happening and this is a very common practice in video editing not just with audio but with visuals as well the L cut or the J cut and that helps to sort of give the audience or the viewer the anticipation ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 858, Start: 858, Overview: and that helps to sort of give the audience or the viewer the anticipation of what's to come and what's next and it's also just a much cleaner way to edit than just cutting right on this clip so if I played this back that sounds good too especially in this sort of context where everything's ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 870, Start: 870, Overview: back that sounds good too especially in this sort of context where everything's a little chaotic and these like match Cuts however I wanted to add a little bit of that element in that jcut here um just for the sake of creating something really uh just just it's pleasing to the ears you ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 906, Start: 906, Overview: so let's keep on going here's another situation I'm going to turn this down because that is very loud okay this now if we're going into our third sort of tip is called a jump cut all right you've probably seen them before but a jump cut is essentially where you're cutting in between the ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 921, Start: 921, Overview: before but a jump cut is essentially where you're cutting in between the action of One Clip so if I open this clip up in my project and I double click this this is a very long clip it's pretty boring if I were to just put this in and you're just watching ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 933, Start: 933, Overview: were to just put this in and you're just watching me struggle to crack eggs um the sound is there you know the framing is there but the edit is really where this sort of comes together and it makes it something that moves really really fast and in doing that we use ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 949, Start: 949, Overview: makes it something that moves really really fast and in doing that we use what's called a jump cut all right so I'm going to pull over a new sequence we're going to call this jump cut test and we're just going to drag this clip the whole clip um into it let's go back keep those all right so we're going to ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 961, Start: 961, Overview: the whole clip um into it let's go back keep those all right so we're going to go from like here all the way to the end drag this in all right keep those settings boom so as you can see this is a very very long clip okay but the way that I would go about doing this jump cut is to try to make this as quick as ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 976, Start: 976, Overview: that I would go about doing this jump cut is to try to make this as quick as possible and find the spots that maybe look the most visually appealing in this case the cracking of the egg is a great audio cue as well so I'm going to find where that is okay that's a little tooo loud let's ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 987, Start: 987, Overview: where that is okay that's a little tooo loud let's maybe go down the line here and let's go to like this one all right so we're going to just cut this whole part out command k w is a ripple delete uh I have done that and I've added my own shortcuts if you don't ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 1010, Start: 1010, Overview: whatever uh whatever effect or whatever tool you're trying to use and then customize them to your liking to whatever uh works for you all right so we can actually still remove some of that command K all right so I'm gonna go command K so that part right there is one little cut ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1021, Start: 1021, Overview: K all right so I'm gonna go command K so that part right there is one little cut now the beauty of the jump cut is now we can take another part of this maybe we like the sound of me cracking it open command K double click that so now all we're going to do is we're just basically creating a distance ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1035, Start: 1035, Overview: that so now all we're going to do is we're just basically creating a distance of time Jump Cuts allow you to use a clip to cover more time rather than the viewer sitting there and watching the entire like three minute span of you creating this this uh egg mixture okay and it allows you to not only hook the ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1049, Start: 1049, Overview: creating this this uh egg mixture okay and it allows you to not only hook the viewer keep them engaged but then to cover that span of time uh in a really creative way cool so we're already getting something nice we got that uh sound q and let's maybe get like one more little ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1062, Start: 1062, Overview: something nice we got that uh sound q and let's maybe get like one more little thing here command K if we play that back that's cool and I think we're good with that all right so if we look back at what we actually did here very very similar cool and I continued that uh ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1077, Start: 1077, Overview: actually did here very very similar cool and I continued that uh style I continued that sort of transitional style all the way down the line here into some of these more these more uh visual cues so if I turn this down we went from cracking the egg jump cut jump cut jump jump cut to the mixing ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1094, Start: 1094, Overview: down we went from cracking the egg jump cut jump cut jump jump cut to the mixing of the egg and if you look at this this is really only like this isn't even a full second clip all right the one big takeaway from this stream and hopefully from you know watching some of these videos is experiment with really cutting ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1108, Start: 1108, Overview: from you know watching some of these videos is experiment with really cutting down these clips if you're looking to create something that's uh a fastpaced movement or a fast-paced video like this because the quicker those cuts are the more your viewer is going to be engaged they may want to watch it again and be ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1122, Start: 1122, Overview: more your viewer is going to be engaged they may want to watch it again and be like oh man like how did they do that um and this is a way where if you're watching your own videos back and you feel like it's too long it's about 2 seconds too long or it's a second too long so really learn to trim trim trim ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1135, Start: 1135, Overview: seconds too long or it's a second too long so really learn to trim trim trim and get comfortable with having these really really quick Cuts it's going to just make your work so much better cool and then here another one of those techniques that we talked about we went from round to round all right so ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1148, Start: 1148, Overview: those techniques that we talked about we went from round to round all right so you look at not everything needs to be this like wipe transition not everything needs to be like a a zoom in transition in this case we went from a shot that had a sort of circular element in it to a shot that had a circular element in it ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1163, Start: 1163, Overview: had a sort of circular element in it to a shot that had a circular element in it but sh from a different way and I think that gives the viewer uh something visually interesting to look at as well and then here we sort of repeated that process of because I'm shooting by myself I need to find ways to have those ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1176, Start: 1176, Overview: process of because I'm shooting by myself I need to find ways to have those wipes while my camera is on a tripod and in this case I did the same thing with the tortilla but now we are in a different location okay so here I didn't necessarily you know wipe these two together but let's say we wanted to add ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1189, Start: 1189, Overview: necessarily you know wipe these two together but let's say we wanted to add a an effect to this to really sell that like push in or that Zoom okay so this is another little trick that you can do to add some of those extra Zoom elements into your project once you've created those transitions in camera all right so ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1203, Start: 1203, Overview: into your project once you've created those transitions in camera all right so you're going to right click you're going to add adjustment layer okay then we're going to drag this adjustment layer over top of the two clips that we want to have that transition happen between all right and we want this to be pretty ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1215, Start: 1215, Overview: have that transition happen between all right and we want this to be pretty quick okay so I'm going to just go 1 two 3 4 five frames we're going to drag this adjustment layer in and then we're going to do the exact same thing to the other side 1 2 3 4 5 frames okay so nothing is going to ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1226, Start: 1226, Overview: side 1 2 3 4 5 frames okay so nothing is going to happen we haven't added any effects to it so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go into my effects panel and I'm going to search for transform this is a I use this uh adjustment layer in this effect all the time for different ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1240, Start: 1240, Overview: I use this uh adjustment layer in this effect all the time for different reasons this is one of the ways that you can uh add that little layer of spice to zoom in and create a really cool transition effect all right so we're going to drag this on to our whoops our adjustment layer again nothing is ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1250, Start: 1250, Overview: going to drag this on to our whoops our adjustment layer again nothing is happening we haven't actually affected anything but what I'm going to do is go up into my effects controls panel we have all of our uh transform features I'm going to set three key frames the first one I'm going to set is right on ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1263, Start: 1263, Overview: I'm going to set three key frames the first one I'm going to set is right on the cut up between those clips then I'm going to go 1 2 3 4 set another key frame and then 1 two 3 4 all right set another key frame hopefully we're still with me okay these are going to remain at 100% our middle key frame we're going ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1277, Start: 1277, Overview: with me okay these are going to remain at 100% our middle key frame we're going to change to 300% because basically what we want to do is like push in to P to pull out okay so we're we're scaling into this property and the important thing you want to do here is uncheck that composition shutter angle here and ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1291, Start: 1291, Overview: thing you want to do here is uncheck that composition shutter angle here and then change that shutter angle to something like 250 or 300 360° this creates like some really really cool motion blur okay so if I play this back we've now taken this uh circular ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1304, Start: 1304, Overview: if I play this back we've now taken this uh circular element My Pan and we've zoomed into it to then zoom out and I think that looks really really cool okay but there's a couple more things that we can do to really sell this effect we're going to go in here and we're going to right ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1318, Start: 1318, Overview: really sell this effect we're going to go in here and we're going to right click our key frames and create an easy out or an ease out and then an ease in all right and then if we highlight these and we scroll down here to our little carrot you can see that I'm going to zoom this in a little bit here you can ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1329, Start: 1329, Overview: carrot you can see that I'm going to zoom this in a little bit here you can see that we have these handles that we can create some even more uh like quick Punchy animations to them so I'm going to hold shift and I'm going to drag oops I'm going to grab my handle here and I'm going to drag this up okay and I'm going ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 1358, Start: 1358, Overview: even though I did not um and again this is all using what's at your disposal using your brain your creative like framing and things like that to try to make these shots with uh intention in mind and have some deliberate action when you're filming them and I think it just comes with practice it comes with ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1372, Start: 1372, Overview: when you're filming them and I think it just comes with practice it comes with doing it often um and it comes with like trying these things you know take your camera it doesn't have to be a cinema camera it doesn't have to be a mirrorless or DSLR whatever it could be your cell phone you can get creative ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1383, Start: 1383, Overview: mirrorless or DSLR whatever it could be your cell phone you can get creative I've seen so many of these videos on Tik Tok on Instagram uh and they're really really fun because each time you learn something new about maybe what you can do the next time how you can sell that transition just that much more all right ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1394, Start: 1394, Overview: do the next time how you can sell that transition just that much more all right so I'm going to hide this first this last layer we have a couple minutes left here and I just want to quickly hit on color correction because that is the one thing that we didn't really get into and think it could really use its own stream ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1405, Start: 1405, Overview: thing that we didn't really get into and think it could really use its own stream personally um but what I'm going to do is because all of these clips are shot you know in the same environment we don't necessarily have to go and add an effect to every single one of those clips it would take too long it's not ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1420, Start: 1420, Overview: effect to every single one of those clips it would take too long it's not very efficient um and there's a much easier way to do it okay so I'm going to remove that and then we're going to do the same thing adjustment layers again like every Adobe program adjustment layers are your best friend they're ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1430, Start: 1430, Overview: like every Adobe program adjustment layers are your best friend they're going to help you kind of create larger effects on uh on a global scale okay so adjustment layer we're going to drag this on to our entire timeline here all right and then we can do like micro tweaks okay so I'm going to rename this ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 145, Start: 145, Overview: really minimalistic uh it's got uh typical coffee shop colors so like warm Brown orange kind of representing coffee and um pastries and very you know just the lines and the colors so since it's really minimalistic once we apply to it uh this image to on the generations and click on generate we ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 163, Start: 163, Overview: to it uh this image to on the generations and click on generate we should get the generations that are within the same style so it will be pretty minimalistic also just um um oranges and Browns U but again Firefly has it has its own mind sometimes it works ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 243, Start: 243, Overview: Generations but I'm looking for something more realistic that I can apply further to my Generations so to get from this really minimalistic view to something more realistic you just need to start applying uh different settings in the settings menu and then just saving and receiving the the images ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 258, Start: 258, Overview: settings in the settings menu and then just saving and receiving the the images that you see that are unbrand more detailed and then just using those images instead of the log image for the new generations so let's try um applying the photo content type uh taking the visual intensity all the way to the left ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 275, Start: 275, Overview: the photo content type uh taking the visual intensity all the way to the left uh what it does is that uh we're telling uh Firefly that we want to generate something very photo realistic so if you take it all the way to the right it's generating something that looks more CGI if you take the settings all the way to ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 289, Start: 289, Overview: generating something that looks more CGI if you take the settings all the way to the left um you would generate something that looks like a photograph um and for the style strength since it's really minimalistic we probably want to take it also all the way to the bottom so only the colors are applied and then um um ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 303, Start: 303, Overview: also all the way to the bottom so only the colors are applied and then um um the visual intensity uh also is uh takes over the generation and I actually also like to use some of the photo settings to really get uh the message across that I'm trying to create a photo not an ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 320, Start: 320, Overview: get uh the message across that I'm trying to create a photo not an illustration so in the photo settings you can use um the different or shutter speed or fi the view settings or also in uh the composition you can apply um the different types of Photography so let's since it's an image ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 335, Start: 335, Overview: apply um the different types of Photography so let's since it's an image of a cup with a croissant let's apply macro photography and generate so the main idea is for us to arrive at an image that has the same color pette and feel but also start we start getting you know more a variety of ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 355, Start: 355, Overview: color pette and feel but also start we start getting you know more a variety of images that we can then later apply to Our Generations so this one looks kind of you know within the same color pette this one does um let me try taking macrophotography out and regenerating and see um if I get a better quality ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 372, Start: 372, Overview: macrophotography out and regenerating and see um if I get a better quality image oh it did not work so let's and I noticed that um applying the photography settings actually helps a lot with um kind of getting uhhuh I was going to say this is what you were talking about earlier when you said Fireflight has a ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 394, Start: 394, Overview: this is what you were talking about earlier when you said Fireflight has a mind of its own um there's a lot of a lot of different things that can happen when you start applying these settings exactly and I feel like you know unfortunately I can't just um do a super clean demo here because you know ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 407, Start: 407, Overview: know unfortunately I can't just um do a super clean demo here because you know while I'm generating I have no idea what will come up but this is this is also a part of the fun right because you're getting completely different images every single time and some of them like are actually better than what you were ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 421, Start: 421, Overview: every single time and some of them like are actually better than what you were expecting so uh for this image I've applied the closeup uh photo setting still kept the photo content type and I'm still I still have my logo design so I would say this image actually represents my um color palette really ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 437, Start: 437, Overview: I would say this image actually represents my um color palette really well so I can just download this image and also add it to my favorite so I keep it for later so now I can go back and reapply uh uh change the the reference ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 458, Start: 458, Overview: back and reapply uh uh change the the reference image to a newly uh generated image so this is the image we've just generated um this is yes the image I own um and let's say now um I can apply this newly generated image with my colorful it to generate something else ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 477, Start: 477, Overview: this newly generated image with my colorful it to generate something else so um the next thing I wanted to generate just to show you like how you can um um yes how you can create backgrounds for your flyers or even posts um uh is by just generating something as ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 492, Start: 492, Overview: posts um uh is by just generating something as simple as an empty coffee shop uh and to make sure that it is empty I would also ex I okay so I go to this um settings menu scroll all the way down click on advanced settings and we have uh an option to exclude um specific ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 511, Start: 511, Overview: down click on advanced settings and we have uh an option to exclude um specific uh elements from the image so here I want to exclude people just to be on a safe site that it's getting the message and also I'll take out these settings so first I want to see uh the default generations and then we'll start playing ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 531, Start: 531, Overview: first I want to see uh the default generations and then we'll start playing so what I've done is just I've put again the visual intensity to the middle strength uh style strength to the middle and I took out the photo settings uh you can take them out by just clicking on the x button uh in the prompt bar and ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 545, Start: 545, Overview: can take them out by just clicking on the x button uh in the prompt bar and let's click on generate so the only thing I'm actually uh using here is a new reference image and then I'm also excluding the um people as elements from uh the generation so now it's generating um a coffee shop for me using a new uh ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 562, Start: 562, Overview: uh the generation so now it's generating um a coffee shop for me using a new uh image right so it's still within my brand still got the same colors um I mean it looks nice but um maybe I want for it to be a little bit more realistic so again let's try adding the photo content type and taking the visual ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 579, Start: 579, Overview: so again let's try adding the photo content type and taking the visual intensity down what it does it's it's making it more photo photo realistic and some of these images are nicer than others oh interesting fact I think I mentioned it last time so when you apply a reference image um it ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 601, Start: 601, Overview: think I mentioned it last time so when you apply a reference image um it doesn't just look at the colors and whether it's a photo or it's a 3D image it's actually also looking at what's in the image so since we do have a cup in the image it's also generating these cups for us so um another way to really ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 620, Start: 620, Overview: the image it's also generating these cups for us so um another way to really manipulate what you're generating next is by um let's say you want to just have really an overview like a view of the coffee shop you don't really don't want like cops in the image so um I think um like this one this well this image looks ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 638, Start: 638, Overview: like cops in the image so um I think um like this one this well this image looks better so let's just download this one and use this image as our um reference instead of the one with the cup well I've already done a few downloads here I'll just use one of the ones I've ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 660, Start: 660, Overview: well I've already done a few downloads here I'll just use one of the ones I've used wanted to to show you the difference so you can just really kind of keep downloading and downloading and just well this one is not really on brand the other one was more on brand but just to show you the difference like ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 676, Start: 676, Overview: brand the other one was more on brand but just to show you the difference like how it's based on your reference image you will actually generate um you'll generate different uh scenes so here because I've used a coffee shop image it's kind of like giving me coffee shop scenes and let's let's say I want to use ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 690, Start: 690, Overview: it's kind of like giving me coffee shop scenes and let's let's say I want to use this coffee shop scene and I actually want to add um people there so let's take out um let's take out the um people um from the excl exclusions and then add let's say um Barista serving ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 709, Start: 709, Overview: let's say um Barista serving coffee so I wanted to show you um the difference so right now the reference image is only coffee shop so there are no cups like no like close-ups of the cups so it kind of gives you this like ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 725, Start: 725, Overview: like close-ups of the cups so it kind of gives you this like this scene of um like Barista serving coffee so you see like it's a coffee shop uh you see the coffee machines in the back um but let's say and I know some of them are better than others so you need to play with the settings but ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 741, Start: 741, Overview: some of them are better than others so you need to play with the settings but just to show you the difference let's say we use the same prompt but now we use our coffee uh mug as the reference image so it's the same prompt no additional settings and I'm just using a different reference ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 756, Start: 756, Overview: additional settings and I'm just using a different reference image what's gonna happen uh so what is I know yeah so what it did is now it's giving you a mug with the latte or coffee um in the image so because you did use an image with uh coffee in it ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 784, Start: 784, Overview: coffee um in the image so because you did use an image with uh coffee in it now um Firefly is looking at a preference image and deciding okay she actually wants to kind of have the coffee in the center of this image so um because of my reference image it gave me this you know like a burst of serving ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 801, Start: 801, Overview: because of my reference image it gave me this you know like a burst of serving coffee but the coffee is kind of like the center of the generation so just to to show you the comparison so here's the first generation and here's the second generation so again like um if you want to manipulate what you're generating get ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 815, Start: 815, Overview: generation so again like um if you want to manipulate what you're generating get very creative with your um reference images and again uh I would say the main thing that you can do here is really play with the effects um like the best Generations I actually got were um like I I used really ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 833, Start: 833, Overview: um like the best Generations I actually got were um like I I used really surprising effects for them um now of course I don't remember which one that was that's always the challenge remembering the recipe and that's why yeah I need to copy the ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 917, Start: 917, Overview: other settings that we've been using um while um generating so it's really easy to replicate that uh similar generation if you're looking for that particular style um so I can't remember exactly but uh so the next thing I wanted to show is like how you can um use let's say u a similar ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 963, Start: 963, Overview: but then I used the art art type so it's not a photo and then I also um I didn't use the logo I actually used um something similar to that cup with a croissant and then I um just used um art instead of photo so I kind of went back and forth right so I started with the logo generated a photo but then use the ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 979, Start: 979, Overview: and forth right so I started with the logo generated a photo but then use the photo to generate the artwork so what that did is I used something more detailed but still within the same color scheme to generate um an illustration that is still detailed but um and has the same color scheme U but which I ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 994, Start: 994, Overview: that is still detailed but um and has the same color scheme U but which I would not be able to do by just using the logo because if I use the logo it would be super minimalistic just lines so you can really kind of bounce back and forth try to generate something more realistic save it as as as a file then ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1008, Start: 1008, Overview: and forth try to generate something more realistic save it as as as a file then just um upload it as a reference image and just go back back and forth between different styles apply different effects where at the end what you're getting is like it's just all on brand all still with this the same feel same color ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 368, Start: 368, Overview: ahead and grab the blob brush here and what this does is depending on your blob brush settings as you paint it'll create like single filed objects instead of path so if you use the regular um brush tool um this is going to create um a let me make this a little bit darker so you can see it this is ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 436, Start: 436, Overview: this might be it I think it was called something else before um but that give makes it so that your um paths won't um intersect because with that checked off off with this checked on it won't you'll see I've got individual shapes here right um but if I have that checked on as I ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 453, Start: 453, Overview: shapes here right um but if I have that checked on as I draw right and if I go over top of this again it's going to continue to merge these shapes together for you so you'll end up with a merged single shape at the end which is easier when you're doing um fill stuff like this if that makes sense ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 498, Start: 498, Overview: go right and I can just if I had a a tablet this task would be much easier but and if you had a tablet too you could also set this to instead of being being um the size being fixed um to be pressure sensitive so as you drew with like a a w or W you know however you pronounce ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 513, Start: 513, Overview: you drew with like a a w or W you know however you pronounce that um it would vary so in this case I just kind of have to go back and forth here needed although I could just it doesn't really matter um if I go over a little bit I can just um bring this to the front object arrange um bring to ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 607, Start: 607, Overview: it can create um things like subject if you have the level of detail turned all the way up um but it usually makes something that's got like a little bit cleaner lines in my opinion um pattern makes pattern swatches um subject makes like you know people and and puppies and ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 766, Start: 766, Overview: and not on a background so something to consider if you did want to have a background in this you just generate it separately with the scene and have subjects um you know be the the river duck in this case um but do make make sure that you go into your layers here CU you can see that it did include um a ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 778, Start: 778, Overview: sure that you go into your layers here CU you can see that it did include um a background just hidden um and it tends to do that um from time to time so you just want to kind of get rid of that and now I can go over I always lose my place on where this is cuz it's in a weird spot there is the live paint ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 794, Start: 794, Overview: my place on where this is cuz it's in a weird spot there is the live paint bucket tool and um in this case everything is creating closed off areas I don't have any um shapes in this that are uh like open and what I mean is there's no like Gap like if you had a do a demo here if you had like a circle ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 812, Start: 812, Overview: there's no like Gap like if you had a do a demo here if you had like a circle right this is a really lame demo um but if if part of this was open right um life Pate wouldn't recognize that this is a a closed area that you can fill um there is a little bit of a workaround for that like if you ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 859, Start: 859, Overview: detection um I'll try like increasing this and see if it works let's do like 50 or 100 something crazy there we go yeah yeah okay you're right Sean that is it so you can see now that I can fill this shape because it's recognizing it as a closed um shape I don't have a color so let's grab a color um so if you ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 874, Start: 874, Overview: as a closed um shape I don't have a color so let's grab a color um so if you increase that width which US just be called Gap detection it will um close off any open areas you have um yeah without the other option is to um you know close it off yourself by like adding another path here ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 2431, Start: 2431, Overview: first let me make it a little bit larger just got the top here so you're going to me your pixel brushes you can see you can pick from a whole bunch you can also load Kyle's brushes in here as well if you wanted to use any of those um pick like a nice actually I want the pastel brushes I don't even see them in ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 2460, Start: 2460, Overview: um pastel or the pixel brushes first so um again you can see this is going to be if you want more of like a textured look um to your illustration I can kind of paint in here um very poorly with the Mouse um you know clean it up a little bit if we ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2478, Start: 2478, Overview: you know clean it up a little bit if we wanted to oh that's very large there is a draw inside option um I haven't tested it um we can do that if we have time with a um PDF that I saved out from illustrator really quickly um because typically that should come in as ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2495, Start: 2495, Overview: out from illustrator really quickly um because typically that should come in as Vector shapes and that might work with the draw side I haven't tested it um the other option is you've got you know your vector brushes and these do create Vector paths so if you work with a vector brush you could uh export out ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2508, Start: 2508, Overview: Vector paths so if you work with a vector brush you could uh export out those that file um as a PDF and import it into illustrator um the downside to that is it does create expanded paths oh no these are live brushes this is the factor brush um it does create expanded paths so you don't get like ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 2539, Start: 2539, Overview: brushes were the last one that I want to show you um because I think it would be really cool like particularly with this um illustration is or this coloring page um is the uh I'm losing my train of thought the live brushes um and these mimic certain um materials here so if we ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 2582, Start: 2582, Overview: option for like the where is it um there's a shape some there's an option somewhere here for like the flow maybe I'm crazy oh yeah water flow um you can bring this up or down bringing it down is going to make like uh thicker like you know less like if you add less ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2598, Start: 2598, Overview: it down is going to make like uh thicker like you know less like if you add less water to watercolors and this this one is going to make like a more flowy um like you can see this is spreading a lot more um depending on where I paint this this the live brushes are really um nice when you're using oh ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 2631, Start: 2631, Overview: so we can bring this down the size um then we can go over here and change the color and we can just like paint in come on you know we could paint in the elephant's trunk or something really quickly just to kind of demonstrate how this works you can see it behaves very ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2651, Start: 2651, Overview: quickly just to kind of demonstrate how this works you can see it behaves very much like watercolor and that like as I paint over this um it's going to like darken um the more times and I like go over top of the color like it's adding more paint to the surface right um and then I could ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2668, Start: 2668, Overview: the color like it's adding more paint to the surface right um and then I could even the the other cool thing about these is that you can mix um so if I go in here and I add like a purple um it's going to blend with my um original color so it's going to start to mix um those colors together ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2685, Start: 2685, Overview: um original color so it's going to start to mix um those colors together especially if you have the flow turned uh or the water flow sorry turned all the way up it's really going to mix if you turn that down um all the way and we just kind of like add it along this Edge for example it's ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2701, Start: 2701, Overview: um all the way and we just kind of like add it along this Edge for example it's going to mix a little bit less although I do have a lot of water already down technically I guess with the first pass I did a it so it's probably going to continue to mix a bit more so there we go um that's kind of a ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2711, Start: 2711, Overview: continue to mix a bit more so there we go um that's kind of a demonstration a quick demonstration of Fresco um let me try I'm going to try to um bring in this PDF I don't know if it's going to work like I said I haven't tested this method yet I just exported out a rubber duck as ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 2744, Start: 2744, Overview: a just make a square and try to put this in place it in okay no it's not going to let me import this PDF I'd have to think about that a little little bit there I know that like believe there's a workflow that you bring in like vector paths into Fresco I don't know if it works with the ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2759, Start: 2759, Overview: that you bring in like vector paths into Fresco I don't know if it works with the draw inside so the cool thing about the draw ins or paint inside the cool thing about the paint inside is if you have um a you know you've drawn something already um this paint inside lets you like paint inside of the shapes that ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2775, Start: 2775, Overview: already um this paint inside lets you like paint inside of the shapes that you've already drawn similar to how the Live Paint tool Works um but you can paint like with um brushes uh as so you can if you had like texture brushes I'm trying to think of a good equivalent to what it how it works ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2791, Start: 2791, Overview: texture brushes I'm trying to think of a good equivalent to what it how it works um sort of like creating like a selection but it's not actually a visible selection it's just kind of like creating within that area um so okay is that does anybody have any questions about presco I know this was ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 2821, Start: 2821, Overview: also um you can see not so much here but if I switch to the um Vector brushes really quickly the vector brushes make a separate a different are on a different layer so if your vector if you're working with vectors it's going to make a vector layer versus if you're working with either live brushes which are are ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2836, Start: 2836, Overview: a vector layer versus if you're working with either live brushes which are are pixel base or the pixel brushes it's going to make a pixel layer um so there's like three different types of layers that we've got going on here we've got our image uh the vector layer and the pixel layer and all of this is ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2847, Start: 2847, Overview: we've got our image uh the vector layer and the pixel layer and all of this is working because we've got that um image layer set to multiply at the top so there we go um the vector brush is like the blob brush yeah the vector brush is like the blob brush in Fresco and it makes uh those the same kind of ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2863, Start: 2863, Overview: brush is like the blob brush in Fresco and it makes uh those the same kind of shapes when you export it out you're not going to get paths you're going to get like filled outlined shapes um um in the shape of where you painted with Leonardo da Vinci use Fresco or photoshop honestly it's a per ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 310, Start: 310, Overview: found with um this particular like this coloring page this core promp tier coloring page black and white line does tend to go a little crazy in model one with the lines but if for the most part you can see I'm not getting any gray so this does work really well in one for getting rid of ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 325, Start: 325, Overview: not getting any gray so this does work really well in one for getting rid of all that gray and color so um it's a good starting point so from there you know that's kind of what we've you know discovered um now I've got a question Jack what's up are you using any type of commas to break your prompt up no I ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 341, Start: 341, Overview: Jack what's up are you using any type of commas to break your prompt up no I don't I don't okay because if you look into chat mhm I put in a coloring page black and white line art bold lines wobbly lines chicken donut cartoon and it is they're like icons I have no background um I'm ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 384, Start: 384, Overview: you you're saying you put commas in I did put Comm was in and I just removed them and now it's it's gone totally different I mean completely different like there's no donut but they gave me an actually a really good rooster or it's a chicken I don't know I'll put it ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 463, Start: 463, Overview: different now well I was getting the that before when I removed a picnic and just had cute puppies um adding more comment seems to simplify it even more um isolating the puppy is kind of completely on either side by a coma so ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 479, Start: 479, Overview: kind of completely on either side by a coma so maybe um might be something to try if you don't want any kind of background uh the downside is that we're now we're starting to get some uh Grays back in for some reason um which can still happen with this ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 1440, Start: 1440, Overview: me um share the link to this one okay oh I love this one it's beautiful okay you know um speaking of this pattern creation kind of similar to what we talked about last week it would be cool to take this pattern you've made and use it as like uh the reference like ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1462, Start: 1462, Overview: be cool to take this pattern you've made and use it as like uh the reference like the style sample in text a vector for pattern creation and see how close it gets maybe I'll try to do that on the side that'd be awesome yes so um you've got the uh Link in your in in the chat you can just reuse that well get it ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 1494, Start: 1494, Overview: getting so this style has fewer detail it's obviously a different color scheme so let me try this again so um it's still wasn't the same Kawaii type style so I just I obviously you don't have to use the Kawai style for references I just was a little um it it just was easy for me to kind of pull on these Styles ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1511, Start: 1511, Overview: just was a little um it it just was easy for me to kind of pull on these Styles off of stock and um try these different images but um it doesn't have to be a Kawai style as a reference images um as I'm using here so again um so this is still like a Kawai yarn pattern so I as you can see ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1535, Start: 1535, Overview: so again um so this is still like a Kawai yarn pattern so I as you can see like it's still generating a pattern for you less busy so you see like more just you know just characters and some detail so it's really taking that uh Style Style you just used uh in the reference and applying it to the pattern ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1552, Start: 1552, Overview: uh Style Style you just used uh in the reference and applying it to the pattern PN so it's making it a little bit easier for you to see like oh I don't want a busy pattern I actually want main characters so you can use the reference image with pure details to guide that Generation Um okay let me try I haven't ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1567, Start: 1567, Overview: image with pure details to guide that Generation Um okay let me try I haven't tried yarn on any of the other ones but wanted to show you what happens if it's just it's not really a pattern it's just a character it's more 3D um this is what I just used again it's it's coming from Adobe stock um so this is um an image ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 1609, Start: 1609, Overview: yarn and it's just generated one character for me which in some cases is fine right cuz you just need let's say one character and then you just just want to like change this maybe to like cat yarn dog yarn food yarn and then um com uh combine all of those characters in Photoshop and create a pattern ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1624, Start: 1624, Overview: com uh combine all of those characters in Photoshop and create a pattern yourself but if you want to still keep um generating patterns in uh Firefly I have tried um I have tried adding uh to The Prompt repeat many times sometimes it works sometimes it ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 1230, Start: 1230, Overview: you know it just creates whatever it wants so I just wanted to like give you a couple examples of like how um I would go about creating logos and just try different ways to come up with like the variations that you like um so One logo I tried this morning um is um um like well I I prefer to type the most ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1245, Start: 1245, Overview: I tried this morning um is um um like well I I prefer to type the most important words first and then uh kind of like go from the most to least important important words in the prompt the logo uh wolf writing a bike that's another hack I actually got from um the uh the research team that's ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1274, Start: 1274, Overview: bike that's another hack I actually got from um the uh the research team that's working on the prompting they said um the algorithm usually goes word by word so if you really want something in your image make sure you put it first just another like tip for prompting yeah that's ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1291, Start: 1291, Overview: another like tip for prompting yeah that's great yeah so like you got these logos but obviously you know there's a lot of detail you might want to use some of them might not so to start changing uh the feel of the logo you can upload um sub like an image that kind of speaks to ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1309, Start: 1309, Overview: the feel of the logo you can upload um sub like an image that kind of speaks to what um your you would like for the logo to look like so I just um got a couple examples that you can use while um uh generating different types of logos so sample line so this is just an example of a ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1329, Start: 1329, Overview: sample line so this is just an example of a logo with the color scheme and also the level of fidelity so just like kind of explaining to the model hey I want to use these colors and I want for my generation to be at that level of detail and also like you know like a little bit ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1344, Start: 1344, Overview: generation to be at that level of detail and also like you know like a little bit of the 3D feel so this is kind of what you're getting and what I noticed because I uploaded an image of a head of a lion uh it actually just generated like it it decided that I'm looking for like the ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1360, Start: 1360, Overview: it actually just generated like it it decided that I'm looking for like the head of the wolf right so you can also play with like if you have an image of maybe the whole body so if you upload that image uh the model will actually uh decide hey um she's looking for the body on the bike not just the head of the ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1376, Start: 1376, Overview: decide hey um she's looking for the body on the bike not just the head of the wolf so again like you can play with different reference images different um different um you know like uh compositions that you're uploading for the references and um you'll be getting pretty different results so like that's ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1390, Start: 1390, Overview: the references and um you'll be getting pretty different results so like that's kind of like you know uh kind of like this one this one uh so this is one example let's just try a different example oh also another way to uh control the Fidelity of um the uh of the logo uh is through Visual intensity so ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1404, Start: 1404, Overview: control the Fidelity of um the uh of the logo uh is through Visual intensity so if you take it a little bit down so like um so when you're creating art so it's not it's not photos it's art um the visual intensity means the level of detail you're creating in your loog uh in your um outputs so if you want ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1421, Start: 1421, Overview: detail you're creating in your loog uh in your um outputs so if you want something that's really low Fidelity uh just um almost like you know just very little detail take it down to you know like to the left if you want a lot of detail obviously take it up to the right um so we'll see what happens ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1436, Start: 1436, Overview: lot of detail obviously take it up to the right um so we'll see what happens um sometimes like it's it it takes some practice in like playing to see like you know if you come up with like the right level of detail so this one's kind of cute but um a little too much for a logo and you can always obviously refresh and ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1450, Start: 1450, Overview: cute but um a little too much for a logo and you can always obviously refresh and just see if the next version set of set of uh images works better than the previous set and again like if you like if you were like oh man I actually like the previous set more you can always go back in the browser and get to the ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1466, Start: 1466, Overview: the previous set more you can always go back in the browser and get to the previous sets well this one actually turned out pretty cute uh so we can try a couple more examples um just to show you how different uh types of references affect the outcomes so it's ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1482, Start: 1482, Overview: different uh types of references affect the outcomes so it's still the same prompt but then the references this really dark um gray black a little 3dh reference image um so I was trying to come up with something like metal looking and um this is kind of like what ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1500, Start: 1500, Overview: come up with something like metal looking and um this is kind of like what you would get so this is there's a whole body of a bird so the model's like okay she's trying to uh generate something that uh looks like a wolf actually riding on a bike so it would give you these um uh these visuals and again i' ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1513, Start: 1513, Overview: riding on a bike so it would give you these um uh these visuals and again i' I've put the visual intensity to the bottom so let's try the Next Generation with a higher visual density oh like this one this one's kind of cute and funny yeah so like see i' I've I've pushed the toggle a little bit like to ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1540, Start: 1540, Overview: funny yeah so like see i' I've I've pushed the toggle a little bit like to the middle and it gave me uh results with more details so obviously you can play and see if you like um more details less details since it's a logo you might actually want a little less detail and one more example where it's just ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1556, Start: 1556, Overview: actually want a little less detail and one more example where it's just really black and white outlines just to show how um you can play with different styles I also have pulled up if it's interesting after we play with the logo on Firefly I have illustrator open too and I was thinking what might be ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1579, Start: 1579, Overview: on Firefly I have illustrator open too and I was thinking what might be interesting is if you have a logo that you like from this you could send the link to me I can bring it into illustrator and use it as a reference for a logo and illustrator and see what happens yeah and I mean this would be a ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 315, Start: 315, Overview: way to do this is we could round both of them uh or all four of them rather so they're all rounded exactly the same amount and then I could come in and then just pull it out pull the bottom corners out um all the way uh until they're sharp which creates perfect arch um just a a Nifty little Nifty little trick ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 935, Start: 935, Overview: just like the same sort of vibe and see what it see what it does see if we get something we can use Al together um and I'll just uh honestly this is actually pretty cool right here that's pretty neat um let's go ahead and also do moving diagonally like we did with the other one moving ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 954, Start: 954, Overview: do moving diagonally like we did with the other one moving diagonal I got to sound it out uh let's see if that gives us something that is like just within that Circle something that moves not the shape of the circle uh that's beautiful I wish it weren't so bright but or maybe ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 748, Start: 748, Overview: because I because I have it handy has been for the ability to upload images and use those to guide synthesis and so we've always imagine this being kind of a a multi-art approach where you can use an image for style uh you could also use image for structure and you could kind of mix those things together right so ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 764, Start: 764, Overview: image for structure and you could kind of mix those things together right so you could say like well I want to take my living room but I want to you know use a oil painting style and rather than just describing those with text which of course you can still do you could could have your specific living room and this ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 777, Start: 777, Overview: course you can still do you could could have your specific living room and this like specific oil painting kind of mix those together so um as you can see this has been like two to one top request uh folks have had um so the good news is now you can um as hopefully you've seen upload an image in um in Firefly and you ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 789, Start: 789, Overview: now you can um as hopefully you've seen upload an image in um in Firefly and you can use that as you're seeing here this image uh use that to then guide the synthesis process um the thing I just wanted to put my finger on for a second is how do we do that in a way where we don't basically make a ripoff engine ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 806, Start: 806, Overview: is how do we do that in a way where we don't basically make a ripoff engine right like just to put it plainly and believe me we talked about this for a lot of time um and you're you're kind of balancing competing goals right on the one hand it's like all right I'm walking my dog I see some beautiful sun sunlet ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 821, Start: 821, Overview: one hand it's like all right I'm walking my dog I see some beautiful sun sunlet leaves I'm inspired I'd like to be able to mix that into my creation great no one would be like yeah you shouldn't do that on the other hand it's like okay I go browse some anel Adams images I download one and I mix that in is that ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 842, Start: 842, Overview: starts to feel not great um so how do we technically kind of make it so you can you know enable and encourage the one but not the other and there's not a a silver bullet I'll just say that from the jump but the cool thing is like when you upload something we now do check for uh content authenticity credentials so ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 856, Start: 856, Overview: you upload something we now do check for uh content authenticity credentials so there's a a credential around uh basically letting you say can this work be used with AI like is this okay like if if you put something on beand somebody were to download it um there should be some way for you to express ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 885, Start: 885, Overview: really what it all is um basically it's it's just standards it's not like DRM like oh prevent somebody from copying of a movie because frankly people are going to get around that stuff pretty readily it's more around helping uh ethical honest creators you know treat each other in the way you want to be treated ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 898, Start: 898, Overview: honest creators you know treat each other in the way you want to be treated and so we're starting by enabling um the scanning for this data but uh in the near future I hope we will make it really easy for you to like Place those parameters onto your work uh and to go and check to see uh whether those are in ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 1042, Start: 1042, Overview: it in the image pixels in an invisible way again not to to creep on anybody this is something you would choose to do but when you do that then if that image gets moved around and somebody you know opens it in a future version of Photoshop and it's like oh cool like I want to you know make you know Gus to ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 1172, Start: 1172, Overview: like I think it's interesting now this is like the first time that sharing a link has been a lot more useful than just copying and pasting a prompt right like because copy and paste a prompt you get most of it like maybe you don't get like all the seeds and you don't get the stuff on the right but you get the bulk ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 1494, Start: 1494, Overview: bookmark oh and and also with with the generative match stuff I just here's a nice demo I did where um I found I think this was the preset that's in the Firefly stream and just by uploading different images not changing the prompt at all I was able to get these like wildly different creations and again you ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1507, Start: 1507, Overview: at all I was able to get these like wildly different creations and again you can take any image uh you've got again be mindful of copyright please but but uh yeah just like getting these like completely different things and I I wouldn't have uh I wouldn't even know how to prompt for that I don't know ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1521, Start: 1521, Overview: wouldn't have uh I wouldn't even know how to prompt for that I don't know really how to describe that but but it's the vetruvian man is that what it it does it does we we needed like another hand behind it you know but then people would say we don't know about fingers which and be ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1535, Start: 1535, Overview: you know but then people would say we don't know about fingers which and be like no we do we we actually do know um also here's one one tip that's kind of helpful to know so there's this slider visual intensity candidly it's not like my favorite name like what does that mean um but it's it's sort of a realism ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1548, Start: 1548, Overview: my favorite name like what does that mean um but it's it's sort of a realism slider and so here's the same prompt and if you crank up the visual intensity um you know maybe you can see it's like slightly more like smooth skin and it's like this sort of like uh more illustrative look whereas if you go to ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1561, Start: 1561, Overview: like this sort of like uh more illustrative look whereas if you go to the left uh this this looks like a straight up picture you'd see on Facebook um and so the the visual intensity is cranked down on that one um so that is all available uh over here um on the right so there you go ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1575, Start: 1575, Overview: so that is all available uh over here um on the right so there you go visual intensity you can mess with that I have no idea actually what it would do with this dog and I'm a little scared so like but why why not just mess with these things in front of friends and see what happens I don't I mean that's ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1591, Start: 1591, Overview: these things in front of friends and see what happens I don't I mean that's what's cool is like the possibility space is so big you can't possibly have tried everything so I'm just curious so I have this uploaded little sloth I have the exact same uh close-up of a Mystic golden doodle Like a Phoenix red and ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1604, Start: 1604, Overview: the exact same uh close-up of a Mystic golden doodle Like a Phoenix red and blue colors digital um H okay well this one is so illustrative but what if I just get rid of the sloth and hit generate we'll see what it does I mean to some extent part of the challenge for us is like well what do you do when you ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1619, Start: 1619, Overview: to some extent part of the challenge for us is like well what do you do when you give it like mismatched inputs right I'm saying red and blue but then I'm giving it a silver sloth and then I'm like kind of messing with these print well okay I mean that's kind of cool uh but I think you would see this more readily if um ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1632, Start: 1632, Overview: mean that's kind of cool uh but I think you would see this more readily if um you were like trying to do a specific um specific human uh and on that note let me just show you this is like like our internal Wiki uh I wanted to show some of the cool examples people are making and again you know just by taking like ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1648, Start: 1648, Overview: of the cool examples people are making and again you know just by taking like one sort of seed image and then changing the prompt you can get a lot of visual consistency and it feels like every day I wake up check Twitter and somebody is like oh here's a cool tutorial on visual consistency uh usually what they want is ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1660, Start: 1660, Overview: like oh here's a cool tutorial on visual consistency uh usually what they want is is like consistent individuals uh so it's like oh Gus and John are in this storyboard and I always wanted to be specifically those two guys not too like demographically similar guys so we don't really have that yet there's no like way ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1673, Start: 1673, Overview: demographically similar guys so we don't really have that yet there's no like way to make like a gus token John token obviously that would be great we would love to offer that but in the short term if you just want to get like a consistent style using a particular reference image is a really powerful way ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1685, Start: 1685, Overview: consistent style using a particular reference image is a really powerful way to do that and um actually I think what's interesting here is it's the same prompt uh I don't know offhand what it is but you know I'm sure it's something Eagle related and again just changing that that one image produces like really ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1696, Start: 1696, Overview: Eagle related and again just changing that that one image produces like really different results I like this of blinged out Baroque Eagle might have to use him in way when you showed those uh dog portraits a second ago it had me thinking probably one of the easiest Etsy side hustles you could start right ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1710, Start: 1710, Overview: thinking probably one of the easiest Etsy side hustles you could start right now is doing like stylized Pet Portraits for people where you have a reference of their pet and then you do you know you can come with your own style using gen AI but that's like then your like that would be pretty easy pretty cool come it ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1725, Start: 1725, Overview: AI but that's like then your like that would be pretty easy pretty cool come it would and and no one is asking for this which is of course why will then go and do it but uh I just wanted to show so again we Al not only I have a work blog I have a family blog uh and let's see okay I just wanted to show so this was ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1742, Start: 1742, Overview: I have a family blog uh and let's see okay I just wanted to show so this was done a couple years ago so this is my son and our our dog Sheamus and you know there's that doge mean do G but it also doge is like uh like a medieval Venetian ruler so we just thought it' be funny to like put our Doge like yo dog I I made ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1760, Start: 1760, Overview: ruler so we just thought it' be funny to like put our Doge like yo dog I I made your Doge into a doge and so we found somebody on on Etsy or wherever and they like they made us this uh beautiful print and it's it's hanging in Finn's room um oh yeah and also this guy has mustache goals but that's unrelated uh ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1773, Start: 1773, Overview: room um oh yeah and also this guy has mustache goals but that's unrelated uh but yeah to your point Gus I mean actually you know this might be interesting to people on on this call is like we want to make it so that you can create like practical uh commercially interesting stuff again part of why we ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1786, Start: 1786, Overview: create like practical uh commercially interesting stuff again part of why we felt so strongly about training only on work for which we had a proper license is that that lets us turn around and then say Yep this is legally cool you can make derivative stuff and have ownership of that not worry somebody's ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1800, Start: 1800, Overview: can make derivative stuff and have ownership of that not worry somebody's going to sue you and if they do sue you God forbid uh you're indemnified adobe's got your back um let me just show a few more examples uh again this is um always this this is a studio portrait of a fluffy llama hyperrealistic shot on a ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1813, Start: 1813, Overview: this this is a studio portrait of a fluffy llama hyperrealistic shot on a white cyc llama um and again just just different styles um also the the level of realism we can get is is pretty wild so again if you turn down that um that visual intensity slider sorry I thought I could click on this guy for some ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1827, Start: 1827, Overview: visual intensity slider sorry I thought I could click on this guy for some reason I can't um oh here we go yeah let's hopefully it'll load um but yeah like I don't know if it'll come through with a video compression but like uh that's really nice right that's nuts look at the look at the ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1839, Start: 1839, Overview: but like uh that's really nice right that's nuts look at the look at the pores on this guy um which not something I usually say um and I was joking on Twitter because it's sort of like you know the worry it's like AI gets so good who needs Photoshop but then opportunity AI gets so good you need photosh to ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1852, Start: 1852, Overview: who needs Photoshop but then opportunity AI gets so good you need photosh to photoshop out the blemishes H see so we're always thinking um not not serious we never paint ourselves into a corner that's right that's right you always you always have to keep it's like granting someone Eternal Youth and then sing ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1867, Start: 1867, Overview: always have to keep it's like granting someone Eternal Youth and then sing sentencing them to life in prison you know you always have to you have to get it back um but but just um right showing showing some of these uh showing this one to the guys at the gym and they were then critiquing this dude's diet they're ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1879, Start: 1879, Overview: one to the guys at the gym and they were then critiquing this dude's diet they're like well you never put that glaze on the wings you never get that ripped anyway but I love that like that's the kind conversation you can now have based on on AI art um uh one of our teammates Lee loves sloths don't know what the ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1888, Start: 1888, Overview: on on AI art um uh one of our teammates Lee loves sloths don't know what the back story is oh shoot that didn't work um but but yeah he he does a lot of sloth based uh visuals um so so yeah like you know obviously please do come and play and give us your feedback um as always there's the little ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1907, Start: 1907, Overview: please do come and play and give us your feedback um as always there's the little thumbs up thumbs down uh buttons um on on work the one that we take like the we we pay pay most attention to his flag hopefully you'll very rarely have to use that which is report um but if there is anything like really problematic like ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1920, Start: 1920, Overview: that which is report um but if there is anything like really problematic like I'm not going to go through with it but like I don't know if this was like not safe for work or this was like a copyright violation um we do want to please hear about that you know and it's it's a very small stream but we we put ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1930, Start: 1930, Overview: please hear about that you know and it's it's a very small stream but we we put those at the top of the queue of stuff to look at U but even just the thumbs up thumbs down helps the model team understand um what you like um and by the way there's another feature that um that's kind of subtle ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1942, Start: 1942, Overview: the way there's another feature that um that's kind of subtle but I wanted to mention so if you turn on suggestions which is on by default um so capibara it'll be like oh do you want a capibara with a high hedron attract okay I don't know what that is but anyway let's go with a river and a tree ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1962, Start: 1962, Overview: okay I don't know what that is but anyway let's go with a river and a tree on one side and we'll we'll generate this guy um but basically we're using a language model to kind of build out the richness of the prompts that you can uh put in so we'll see what this guy comes up with ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1974, Start: 1974, Overview: put in so we'll see what this guy comes up with we have some quick feedback from and chat around um what eventually once credits are being like counted uh at some point um they had said basically when they do roll out that auto generation that happens sometimes like ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1989, Start: 1989, Overview: when they do roll out that auto generation that happens sometimes like you know if you select like new parameters it automatically goes it would be nice if instead it was like you always prompt it when it actually goes so you're not accidentally using credits before you're ready I think I think ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2001, Start: 2001, Overview: so you're not accidentally using credits before you're ready I think I think that's what you mean let me know if I to clarify yeah completely agreed and in fact um I want to think that we have no more cases where it autogenerator you and like you know need ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2015, Start: 2015, Overview: cases where it autogenerator you and like you know need needless to say uh by the way so yeah hopefully these are some pretty visually realistic capy bars uh let me just crank up the visual intensity just for the laws and see what happens um and see if they're like more I don't know painterly ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2036, Start: 2036, Overview: laws and see what happens um and see if they're like more I don't know painterly or stylized um they're going to look beautiful yeah it's just for what definition beautiful that that's an interesting interesting topic uh oh God those are beautiful holy cow okay ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2048, Start: 2048, Overview: interesting interesting topic uh oh God those are beautiful holy cow okay Majestic Majestic happy my son by the way uh has always done a David atenor like uh malas faki which is Alias fake name and um so I'm like yes you're definitely my boy um right right that's right you do you ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2067, Start: 2067, Overview: definitely my boy um right right that's right you do you have these little moments where you're like all right cool like the next generation is at least gonna be uh ironic if not anything else um but but yeah like time is going by as it usually does I I wanted to mention um so on my ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2082, Start: 2082, Overview: yeah like time is going by as it usually does I I wanted to mention um so on my blog uh sorry to keep plugging it but I do have a category for AIML and within that I have a category for just Firefly stuff so you can find just j.com it'll direct you to the right place um but I wanted to mention like within the sneaks ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2098, Start: 2098, Overview: direct you to the right place um but I wanted to mention like within the sneaks there's some some super hot stuff like the again the nice problem to have is there's so many internal Adobe teams who are now taking like the core Firefly models extending those and then integrating them that I'm like oh my I ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2110, Start: 2110, Overview: models extending those and then integrating them that I'm like oh my I didn't even know that so and so was working on that that's pretty cool um and I won't go through these just in the interest of time um but yeah basically Genera a fill for video kind of seems like a big deal um okay I can't resist ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2122, Start: 2122, Overview: Genera a fill for video kind of seems like a big deal um okay I can't resist going to like one part of it uh because I've been staring at this dude's necktie for for way too long um but I'll I'll make this a little bigger um and again watch these at your leisure I think I think there's a YouTube channel where ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2136, Start: 2136, Overview: watch these at your leisure I think I think there's a YouTube channel where they're all they're all organized um hopefully yeah hopefully that's playing but basically the demo uh is just you know drawing a very simple selection around this guy's uh shirt region and then picking and and saying I want there ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2148, Start: 2148, Overview: around this guy's uh shirt region and then picking and and saying I want there to be a neck tie you get the neck tie and then as the video plays it's actually going to like propagate those uh pixels in a realistic way so like as he moves down the stairs you see um the liting is changing his orientation is ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2161, Start: 2161, Overview: he moves down the stairs you see um the liting is changing his orientation is changing and so um you get a pretty realistic result um that's one of many uh if I go to that note if folks here haven't checked out the sneaks from Max I don't know like I think they're really cool ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2177, Start: 2177, Overview: checked out the sneaks from Max I don't know like I think they're really cool every year but this year in particular I was really uh pretty Blown Away by some of them and they're all on YouTube so you can check them out I'm sure we've got some links here in the chat yeah thank thank you and and actually uh ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2189, Start: 2189, Overview: got some links here in the chat yeah thank thank you and and actually uh what's what's rough is like seeing all the things that don't make the cut uh I'm like how can we not also show that so so yeah there was a great a bunch of great stuff on stage and then a bunch of other stuff kind of like waiting in the ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2204, Start: 2204, Overview: great stuff on stage and then a bunch of other stuff kind of like waiting in the wings like makes it maybe needs a little more bake time we'll show it next time um by the way if you're if you're a real die hard here you might remember I've given some sneaks in the past of using 3D to condition uh generation and ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2215, Start: 2215, Overview: given some sneaks in the past of using 3D to condition uh generation and Firefly and uh for various reasons we still haven't shipped it not not for lack of Desire um but this is a a demo of like well what if you you know took that even further and so not only you know be sort of like 3D Primitives but ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2231, Start: 2231, Overview: that even further and so not only you know be sort of like 3D Primitives but you could actually like posable humans right and so like for me using Firefly today you kind of hit some of the limits of the state of the tech like I was trying to make a design for my brother's new truck so he's he he's a trucker he ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2244, Start: 2244, Overview: trying to make a design for my brother's new truck so he's he he's a trucker he bought a milk truck he wanted two cows standing up one cow lying down and they all had to be female and like you wouldn't think that's a big deal but like getting the composition and was was hard just with prompts and so with tools ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2256, Start: 2256, Overview: like getting the composition and was was hard just with prompts and so with tools like this the idea is like you could potentially like sketch a couple cows you could place a you know cow model you could have a posable cow right now maybe most of the time you don't need to do that that's fine um and here it's like ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2269, Start: 2269, Overview: most of the time you don't need to do that that's fine um and here it's like okay you know big whoop it's like all right just placing a 3D model but like then you can give that input basically as an image to Firefly um now one of the reasons we haven't shipped it the quality here is like it's okay um but ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2282, Start: 2282, Overview: reasons we haven't shipped it the quality here is like it's okay um but this is actually based on an earlier version of firefly one of the challenges is like okay you you have to do certain things in sequence like finish the model get it out the door then start building like new ways of using it but let me ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2293, Start: 2293, Overview: get it out the door then start building like new ways of using it but let me show you this is actually pretty cool so what if you could take like a photo of a person like like this little dude uh doing martial arts and then Analyze That and then have that pose applied to the rigged character and then you could use ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2306, Start: 2306, Overview: and then have that pose applied to the rigged character and then you could use that to guide Firefly generation now I think we're getting somewhere kind of interesting right and again like the n The Nutty kind of I don't know that it's like feel like uh Seinfeld it's too much right it's like well you could of course ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2322, Start: 2322, Overview: like feel like uh Seinfeld it's too much right it's like well you could of course cross reference that with style images so like why not take a beautiful oil painting and a particular pose from a photo and you know then get the camera angle you want and turn it into an oil painting and then say in the future oh ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2333, Start: 2333, Overview: angle you want and turn it into an oil painting and then say in the future oh this is specifically Gus I don't know doing martial arts uh so so it's the combinatoric power that I think it's really sexy here and again what we're trying to do with saving these recipes is ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2347, Start: 2347, Overview: trying to do with saving these recipes is um is to go Way Beyond just what a prompt alone can capture right so you can actually get like really specific compositions and and have those uh persist in the cloud you know what you know what's really cool what you're ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 2588, Start: 2588, Overview: different panels and tools work and i' I felt so much more empowered being able to go in there at least have a starting place like it usually generates pretty clean subjects and pretty clean scenes without too many points and too many lines and you can use it as like a starting place for you know some ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 2927, Start: 2927, Overview: this little area on the right hopefully you're seeing all this uh and be able to like sketch out a different Coastline uh keep the prompt the same and then hit ref fresh um obviously this is like just prototype UI and get a totally different composition um and that one was like kind of cool but like these ones to me ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2941, Start: 2941, Overview: composition um and that one was like kind of cool but like these ones to me are are even cooler so it's like oh I want these specific mountains and I want this specific River in that place again you're not supposed to spend a bunch of time trying to make that fine art you're just giving it a little bit of coaching ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 2965, Start: 2965, Overview: want him going that way right so the example I gave of like hey my brother wants two cows standing up one cow lying down I can easily imagine be like okay roughly here's a cow here's a cow and there's like another cow lying down and so just giving it a little bit of guidance could be super powerful um yeah ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2976, Start: 2976, Overview: so just giving it a little bit of guidance could be super powerful um yeah and so I think part of the tri oh sorry go oh yeah just like figuring out how do these how do these pieces come together and so like we're we're we like a duck under the water like furiously paddling trying to get the stuff in your hands so ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 3001, Start: 3001, Overview: image plus a sketch but um yeah it's a question comment yeah yeah it's from dehum actually and I missed it from earlier so thanks for posting it in also hey good to see you um I know you've been here hanging out so it's always nice to have you in the chat uh so this is the question when it comes to ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 3013, Start: 3013, Overview: nice to have you in the chat uh so this is the question when it comes to uploaded imagery will Adobe Sensei check against a database of known images logos or other intellectual property and decide what is appropriate to use for scaffolding or styling so I think those will be specifically for uploading ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 3025, Start: 3025, Overview: scaffolding or styling so I think those will be specifically for uploading reference images yeah yeah so that that actually is a great idea it's one of the things we talked about and we kind of debated like do we make that a prerequisite before we turn on the Style Match uh or ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 3036, Start: 3036, Overview: like do we make that a prerequisite before we turn on the Style Match uh or generative match feature ultimately we turned it on without that check but I think that would be a really powerful thing to layer in right like we could take a known database like bamp or like Lightroom right basically like Cloud uh ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 3048, Start: 3048, Overview: take a known database like bamp or like Lightroom right basically like Cloud uh collections that adobe manages and uh check against those um potentially we could also you know there's other repositories right so like check for likenesses check for Logos again the the goal here like we want to find the right ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 3060, Start: 3060, Overview: likenesses check for Logos again the the goal here like we want to find the right balance we don't want to stifle creative expression um and at the same time part of not stifling it means like not not letting people's work be used in a way they don't they don't uh approve of right so so I think it'll be this ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 3076, Start: 3076, Overview: they don't they don't uh approve of right so so I think it'll be this ongoing balance and negotiation and and getting your feedback on that I think um and uh yeah just because again a case like this it's like well okay let's say we we recognize the Nike Swoosh should we let people upload it I ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 772, Start: 772, Overview: oh my God I still misspelled it forget it let's leave it alone okay let's move on to including them within this scene so of course our background file is going to have to be introduced from behind right here but in this case it's not going to because we're going to key out that ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 786, Start: 786, Overview: but in this case it's not going to because we're going to key out that that blue that we have here so we don't put it on behind the layer we put it on top so right now we can't see what's beneath it we can't see our files just yet we just got to make sure to stretch it to ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 802, Start: 802, Overview: it we can't see our files just yet we just got to make sure to stretch it to fit the entire the entire length of all three videos and we're gonna go into effects so let's go into effects and look for key and we're going to look for color key ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 817, Start: 817, Overview: key and we're going to look for color key we're going to add that to that top layer which is our backgrounds and I'm saying background but it's not background okay we're going to put it in our foreground for now go to our effect controls and make sure to select a blue ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 829, Start: 829, Overview: our foreground for now go to our effect controls and make sure to select a blue and just like that that area now is visible so our our videos are visible it's perfect now I still want to do one more thing here I think I want to resize this so it's it gets squeezed within that scene ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 846, Start: 846, Overview: here I think I want to resize this so it's it gets squeezed within that scene a little bit better so that says 37 my skill is 37. that's great and I like my position there so one thing that I love doing is not just copying the scale but copying the entire motion section all those motion effects ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 861, Start: 861, Overview: copying the scale but copying the entire motion section all those motion effects and you can copy several effects at once and go to your next scene and just paste it within that motion click on motion paste same for this one click on motion paste and it will be applied ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 875, Start: 875, Overview: same for this one click on motion paste and it will be applied so you see that 37 is there if you had a different positioning if you had different rotation different anchor points all of those live within motion so that's an easy way to just copy and paste several things at once ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 889, Start: 889, Overview: so that's an easy way to just copy and paste several things at once okay so let's see how that looks awesome right now we don't hear audio because we're nested within that folder right so let's bring in our next file which should be going rather fast here we want to cover ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 906, Start: 906, Overview: which should be going rather fast here we want to cover as much as possible let's see yes that's the one we want so we're going to bring it in and it's actually perfect that it has a gap because we're going to introduce it a little bit later but already says special place awesome so we ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 918, Start: 918, Overview: introduce it a little bit later but already says special place awesome so we want to add an effect to this so we're going to go into effects and I'm going to look for twirl and add that effect so instead of it just appearing just because it's part the clip is introduced we're going to do ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 933, Start: 933, Overview: just appearing just because it's part the clip is introduced we're going to do something kind of fun with it and so let's go into effects here let's go into effects and great okay so now with our playhead at the very start we're going to hit that ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 951, Start: 951, Overview: great okay so now with our playhead at the very start we're going to hit that angle that is currently at zero so you can see here see that it's at zero and we're gonna move it right but not yet first let's hit that that animation on so that little stopwatch now we have a keyframe there available ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 967, Start: 967, Overview: animation on so that little stopwatch now we have a keyframe there available oh wow a helicopter just passed my my light moved a little bit okay so then we have it at zero which is the final effect so we can move over that keyframe onto a few steps forward and then now that ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 992, Start: 992, Overview: keyframe onto a few steps forward and then now that we've selected that keyframe I mean we have that key frame in our future essentially we can now twist this over and that looks super cool I love how that looks so we can do it pretty exaggerated actually right we can go ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1007, Start: 1007, Overview: that looks so we can do it pretty exaggerated actually right we can go pretty far in like this let's do that just for fun because we love experimenting cool so we can do that or we can go back to that keyframe and reduce that to a little bit less I might want it around ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1025, Start: 1025, Overview: to that keyframe and reduce that to a little bit less I might want it around there and to make it even better we're gonna right click and hit busier busier I always feel a little bit French when I say that and that looks awesome so that looks great to me you can go ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1041, Start: 1041, Overview: and that looks awesome so that looks great to me you can go really crazy and go the full spiral if you want right so it looks like this and you can determine how fast or how slow it arrives at that point we can put those keyframes closer to make that point be even faster right ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1059, Start: 1059, Overview: those keyframes closer to make that point be even faster right okay so we're doing great so far let's see how much further we can go so let's go now into that beginning and hit that command D to add that across the song I got to visit that's why we did that in the beginning to that's why we nested it ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1078, Start: 1078, Overview: got to visit that's why we did that in the beginning to that's why we nested it because now that we've nested it we can add an effect transition looping effect we've we had adapted previously and it will apply to the background the intro cover all of it right let's turn off this uh Instagram UI template which ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 469, Start: 469, Overview: internal name uh for lack of a better one maybe it'll be different by the time you can get your hands on it which hopefully isn't too long from now but I just wanted to click a preset and the preset had these three images over on the right and so you've got this cute little robot you've got a living room ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 479, Start: 479, Overview: the right and so you've got this cute little robot you've got a living room and you've got a kind of abstract art and so uh the you know again core idea is dirt simple I'm sure the technology is anything but but again you're really just kind of taking these three things together and you can mix them in Now ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 507, Start: 507, Overview: but again you can just kind of play around and and try to get to an interesting result so you know just for the lulls I was like well let me let me replace these guys and I went and grabbed uh a picture of Frida and a chicken maybe I should go ahead and get rid of the uh ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 522, Start: 522, Overview: a picture of Frida and a chicken maybe I should go ahead and get rid of the uh the other ones okay oh actually it was kind of interesting all right so so you guys are learning as I do I inadvertently hadn't removed the the freed well the the other prompts I'll try that in a second but ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 535, Start: 535, Overview: removed the the freed well the the other prompts I'll try that in a second but again this is where uh well one generative Tech is you know super wild and weird and addictive and also um my kids cannot believe that I actually get paid for this like I can't either guys it's a pretty lucky ticket ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 550, Start: 550, Overview: actually get paid for this like I can't either guys it's a pretty lucky ticket um but just to show you again this is you know uh literally never been done before or seen before but it's like Frida Kahlo it's the Milky Way it's uh it's it's a living room it's a chicken there you go so uh let me back up and ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 565, Start: 565, Overview: it's it's a living room it's a chicken there you go so uh let me back up and um uh let's say a I have no idea if this prompt is going to work but I just wanted to say I grabbed these two images off the internet basically inspired by Nathan ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 583, Start: 583, Overview: grabbed these two images off the internet basically inspired by Nathan making Frida chicken and uh in the spirit of cooking things if if this doesn't quite work I will cut to my Julia Child pre-cooked chicken and we can talk about that um but anyway just in the chat if you ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 596, Start: 596, Overview: we can talk about that um but anyway just in the chat if you have comments questions ideas any initial reactions totally am on us uh we think there can be some really fun experiences we build a couple weeks ago in one of these we met and talked about you know what could be almost game-like ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 609, Start: 609, Overview: in one of these we met and talked about you know what could be almost game-like experiences things which are like really fun and playful sometimes silly sometimes not you know but trying to make something beautiful and interesting um through these tools so this was one of the things we were ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 621, Start: 621, Overview: um through these tools so this was one of the things we were kind of playing with as an idea um so what what you'll see is again if I uh let's see maybe less Frida more chicken I don't know we'll see give it a shot again like the reason this stuff obviously isn't ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 635, Start: 635, Overview: shot again like the reason this stuff obviously isn't shipping is it's not all ready to go it takes a little while to process um but let's see I got some interesting results that I can show you in a second um but again anyway you get the core ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 646, Start: 646, Overview: results that I can show you in a second um but again anyway you get the core concept um so the first interesting one I got again this is sort of just more chicken maybe if I maybe add a little bit more Frida to it it would be interesting um but while that's cooking as it were ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 660, Start: 660, Overview: Frida to it it would be interesting um but while that's cooking as it were uh I just wanted to say well I started to get some weird mutant combinations with like woman with some chicken coming out of her head um probably not what I wanted but but uh it took me in a New Direction which is ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 699, Start: 699, Overview: fascinating kind of to see about I don't know if thanks is the right word but like how the system interprets different different inputs again it's the mixture of the visuals each with its own strength and some combination uh I guess I had Milky Way galaxy in here which is not really coming through but um but ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 711, Start: 711, Overview: I had Milky Way galaxy in here which is not really coming through but um but definitely just kind of a delightful serendipitous place to to play around with things um teammates or or folks on the chat if you got comments questions lay them on me ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 987, Start: 987, Overview: and um obviously we're all very interested in getting a tools right now and I've been playing with mid-journey since it came out a little over a year ago now and I remember being in my backyard just ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 1029, Start: 1029, Overview: if I if I were to sit down and build a large-scale project using only AI tools what would that look like and how would that make me feel as an artist as a Creator and would I get the same sort of satisfaction and what I feel ownership and and just what would that process feel ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1040, Start: 1040, Overview: and and just what would that process feel like I wanted to internalize that and then bring that back to my team so that we could have some of that knowledge and and ideally build products that the mix-ins for our customers so a couple of my goals for this were I want us to feel ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1052, Start: 1052, Overview: mix-ins for our customers so a couple of my goals for this were I want us to feel like a real animated trailer and so I couldn't really use some of the Gen 1 Gen 2 Technologies out there right now because they're a little still too nightmare Fury at times and all those is a bit of a horror movie like it was a ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1063, Start: 1063, Overview: nightmare Fury at times and all those is a bit of a horror movie like it was a little too abstract for my name so I had to uh to use other tools um I wanted to feel like a 3D animated short so because of that I wanted I wanted to actually build 3D assets and so I wanted to start with ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1077, Start: 1077, Overview: wanted to actually build 3D assets and so I wanted to start with um 2D images and then figure out how do I bring those 2D images into 3D space and so I use a set of tools to do that as well um and I want to use AI as much as possible ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1089, Start: 1089, Overview: um and I want to use AI as much as possible in this process so if there was a tool available to do this work on my behalf I wanted to go out there and find it and utilize it I was really inspired by a lot of the work I see across the internet right now but especially on ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1101, Start: 1101, Overview: lot of the work I see across the internet right now but especially on Reddit because it's locked in a centralized and you see these younger creators just taking bits and pieces off the shelf from all over the Internet and smash it together to create these new types of creations and so I was really ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1111, Start: 1111, Overview: smash it together to create these new types of creations and so I was really excited to try that for myself and so that was the impetus for this and then I just eventually they wanted to document the process and again like I said bring that back to the team so to talk a little bit about the process ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1125, Start: 1125, Overview: said bring that back to the team so to talk a little bit about the process and then I'll wrap up with how this whole process made me feel as a creator um I started off in mid-journey and um Firefly and what I'm sharing right here is my storyboard so these are the ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1140, Start: 1140, Overview: and what I'm sharing right here is my storyboard so these are the um 11 images I use to generate this entire video I cheated in one spot and where that lake monster Shadow appears underneath the boat I did make a very very simple 3D model for that if I didn't have that shot method for years ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 1166, Start: 1166, Overview: and really trying to coax my journey and Firefly into giving me exactly what I needed like I actually have these sketched out more or less as you see them here in my Sketchbook and it took a lot of figuring out in terms of how to does anyone just play with these tools it's really hard to get the composition ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1179, Start: 1179, Overview: does anyone just play with these tools it's really hard to get the composition that you want you can get something very beautiful very easily if they get that specific composition is a challenge and this is really where it felt like as a uh it really does feel like it sounds cliche now the road just feel like ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1190, Start: 1190, Overview: a uh it really does feel like it sounds cliche now the road just feel like you're the career director of your project and you're working with this amazingly talented group of artists um but the IRS don't speak the same language and you don't speak the language of any of these artists and so ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1200, Start: 1200, Overview: language and you don't speak the language of any of these artists and so you're constantly trying to figure out how do you communicate to them like your vision and there's a lot of this back and forth and trying different ways of communicating showing them pictures of things that you want sometimes they get ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1209, Start: 1209, Overview: communicating showing them pictures of things that you want sometimes they get it right sometimes they get it wrong um but eventually you get there can you figure it out as you go um and so like I mentioned you're up you're the Creator director and you have this amazing pool of ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1221, Start: 1221, Overview: you're the Creator director and you have this amazing pool of artists that you're working with but you're also kind of the intern in some ways as well or like the new hire and you're doing all this like assembly work underneath the scene so your your your guiding this process and ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1231, Start: 1231, Overview: underneath the scene so your your your guiding this process and guiding all these all this asset creation but you're also the one that's assembling all those assets underneath the hood and so that was the predominantly where I spent most of my time with this project ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1243, Start: 1243, Overview: predominantly where I spent most of my time with this project um but so I took these these images and these these on these top 10 images in particular and used a couple different AI tools to transfer them into 3D images and so when I first did is I brought these ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1257, Start: 1257, Overview: and so when I first did is I brought these um into a stable diffusion extension for automatic 1111 and then I I just basically upscaled them and you can find upscalers anywhere I just happen to use this one and then I brought those into ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1270, Start: 1270, Overview: upscalers anywhere I just happen to use this one and then I brought those into Photoshop and then I used a gen fill to do all my in panel paintings so I knew I needed to extend these sets in order to get that 3D feel and it would also cut out some of these characters and then fill the ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1280, Start: 1280, Overview: 3D feel and it would also cut out some of these characters and then fill the background so that I could have that Parallax feel in 3D when I went to animate and so Photoshop was an amazing tool I spent so much time just um preparing always assets and Photoshop using gen filled ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1293, Start: 1293, Overview: preparing always assets and Photoshop using gen filled um and then I would kick those back over to um so the next stable diffusion and we have some in-house stuff we're working on as well to turn these 2D images into 3D images ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1301, Start: 1301, Overview: on as well to turn these 2D images into 3D images 3D content and then you could actually then bring that 3D content into any 3D application you you you're comfortable using you start to assemble these scenes really really quickly it's very um pretty basic stuff ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1314, Start: 1314, Overview: really really quickly it's very um pretty basic stuff we might face something before leaves because that's what I'm used to but you can easily use blender um and then once you're in um actually I'll just pull up the videos a ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1325, Start: 1325, Overview: um actually I'll just pull up the videos a little easier to explain what's Happening Here been looking at this screen again while James is pulling us up a quick welcome to anyone that's joined recently um James is showing a bit of a ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1345, Start: 1345, Overview: quick welcome to anyone that's joined recently um James is showing a bit of a process for a YouTube video uh trailer that's been primarily created by mostly generated Ai and we put a link in the chat for you if you want to check it out so if you have questions or want James dig deeper on anything he shares feel ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1356, Start: 1356, Overview: so if you have questions or want James dig deeper on anything he shares feel free to put it in the stage chat oh yeah I still I still want to know James I think hap asked the question who did that or maybe just did but who who did the uh the cool vocals yeah I'm wondering too yeah so the vocals um gosh ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1368, Start: 1368, Overview: did the uh the cool vocals yeah I'm wondering too yeah so the vocals um gosh so so much this process was trial and error so again my whole goal was to only try to stick to AI tools as much as possible and not cheat and only and only fill in the gaps where um AI was lacking currently today there ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1383, Start: 1383, Overview: fill in the gaps where um AI was lacking currently today there was a two out there that just wasn't quite favorite build today so um in the case of audio I spent a lot of time digging through um hugging face trying different um ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1394, Start: 1394, Overview: um hugging face trying different um audio spaces for the music I ended up using um meta has a tool for generating music I probably spent a day and a half degenerating music to get that clip that I really felt like fit the mood of this ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1404, Start: 1404, Overview: degenerating music to get that clip that I really felt like fit the mood of this piece but you can also give it influence so you can actually take a instead of existing music pop that in add a prompt similar to it's almost it's almost identical to how you create images with any of these other ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1417, Start: 1417, Overview: almost it's almost identical to how you create images with any of these other generation tools it's this exact same process but it's a slightly different language and so that's why I created the music um for the sound effects I would say about 60 to 70 of the sound effects are ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1427, Start: 1427, Overview: um for the sound effects I would say about 60 to 70 of the sound effects are also generated and those were all through another hugging face space called bark like they used bark for that um and it rapidly creates sound effects so you type in what you want and then it gives you something you're like that's ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1440, Start: 1440, Overview: so you type in what you want and then it gives you something you're like that's fine it kind of works kind of doesn't um spend enough time with it you'll get what you need um and then for the for the voiceover I use two different tools um for these scenes where the um where ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1450, Start: 1450, Overview: use two different tools um for these scenes where the um where the characters actually talking so this is a bit of an involved process um it's kind of hard to tell when I'm just kind of um scrubbing through it here but you like the lights actually for ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1462, Start: 1462, Overview: kind of um scrubbing through it here but you like the lights actually for wrapping out this guy as he moves but this is all from a 3D image um so I did here was I used a tool called div and it's free all almost all the stuff is free except for things like ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1472, Start: 1472, Overview: and it's free all almost all the stuff is free except for things like vegetarian the Adobe products but a lot of stuff just open source and experimental mental right now so people can't really charge a whole lot for it in this case I use did um and basically you can take any image ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1481, Start: 1481, Overview: in this case I use did um and basically you can take any image with a with a human in a human face and a um and then tell it what to say and then it'll generate some ambient motion on that on that image and and lip sync to whatever you have it say and you can ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1494, Start: 1494, Overview: that on that image and and lip sync to whatever you have it say and you can just go through a couple of different voices which you want to use as well or add in your own voice um if that's what you want to do and so just curious so was was that the the British man was that just like a voice ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1506, Start: 1506, Overview: just curious so was was that the the British man was that just like a voice it synthesized for you um well there's two there's two different voices in this in this there's the there's the voiceover and then there's these voices that when like he says what was that and ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1519, Start: 1519, Overview: voiceover and then there's these voices that when like he says what was that and there's another time the guy says it's here and those are from VIP and so in the case of idid video um I explore that out and then I took it into a tool called EB synth and I went back to stable diffusion I took the ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1533, Start: 1533, Overview: into a tool called EB synth and I went back to stable diffusion I took the first frame of the did video because now there's an animating character in this video before which is a 2d character so I needed I need to create a depth map that would match that that new set of frames so I took it back in the stable ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1545, Start: 1545, Overview: that would match that that new set of frames so I took it back in the stable diffusion created depth map and I used BB Sim which is the tool where you can like take a style frame and map it to um piece of footage so it works just as well for mapping depth maps different to footage as well and so now I have this ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1560, Start: 1560, Overview: well for mapping depth maps different to footage as well and so now I have this anime of depth map and I can bring that back into Cinema 4D and extrude that that video in space and now I get light reflect and off roof racking off of this guy whereas before he was just a static image so I was ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1573, Start: 1573, Overview: racking off of this guy whereas before he was just a static image so I was doing all these yeah very subtle light to the scenes and I spent more time on the subtleties than people probably were ever going to pick up on but you can see in the background here like there's a character back there he's moving I have ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1585, Start: 1585, Overview: in the background here like there's a character back there he's moving I have some like little deformers on him there's light refracting all over this cave um there's a lot of stuff you can do and you can push it even further to really play up the 3D nature of this but here's ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1595, Start: 1595, Overview: you can push it even further to really play up the 3D nature of this but here's what I was going for there's much better ways to build generative film when you're just using some tools like gen and gen 1 and Gen 2 and Pica labs and that sort of thing where you're not really focused on the 3D quality of it ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1606, Start: 1606, Overview: that sort of thing where you're not really focused on the 3D quality of it but I was like really focused on making this video like 3D animation so spent a lot of time there oh yeah that's really cool and if I'm not mistaken um some of the core Tech anybody since ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1616, Start: 1616, Overview: not mistaken um some of the core Tech anybody since was designed and developed at Adobe so it's it's nice to see stuff come full circle right on um after one more question for you I'm just ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1627, Start: 1627, Overview: um after one more question for you I'm just curious if you relied on AI for like the concept of the video itself or the script like the actual Ida chat so a little story on the story itself I came up with a story probably back in like 2006 or so ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1642, Start: 1642, Overview: came up with a story probably back in like 2006 or so um I have the original piece of concept art playing around somewhere but it practically I'm going to find it um and actually I need to track these down I create this poster for an adobe competition back in 2006 and I sent it ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1653, Start: 1653, Overview: down I create this poster for an adobe competition back in 2006 and I sent it in in the winter I received a free copy of After Effects um I did not win because they were basically going to take the post journey and made on stage at a conference way back in the day ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1665, Start: 1665, Overview: and made on stage at a conference way back in the day um I did not win but that kind of put me in the Journey of like always thinking about this movie I wanted to make eventually so um so the idea was mine but I did actually use chat GPT to help me ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1674, Start: 1674, Overview: um so the idea was mine but I did actually use chat GPT to help me um finesse the script if you're like some sort of like 19th century horror author um and so I was pulling some old things all the hats these these guys I used to read back in the day and really going ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 1697, Start: 1697, Overview: and the sound again it sounds about shaved but it felt very collaborative in a way that I had not collaborated before with these tools like I would I would spend it my ideas it would send back its ideas I would sit on it for a day I would change it back I would send it back again and back and forth we went ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1710, Start: 1710, Overview: would change it back I would send it back again and back and forth we went over the course of the project until we land on the script that we did oh that is so cool um I just noticed we had a pretty big influx of people uh here in the hangout so I just want to say welcome to ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 1882, Start: 1882, Overview: the little bits and pieces I think would be interesting if anyone has a question I'm happy to answer those as well um get back to original question John in terms of the actual narrator voice I spent a lot of time searching through different tools that made sense for that um paid and free I ended up using 11 ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1894, Start: 1894, Overview: different tools that made sense for that um paid and free I ended up using 11 labs um they have a great um for your generation like Studio space and you kind of just keep hitting generate with different qualities that you want so you get the version sounds ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 1917, Start: 1917, Overview: and then I end up playing on this one it kind of sounds like clybone at the end of the day I didn't realize the time but after I made the video like I was obviously he's narrating my video that's pretty cool and I always liked him so that works for me um ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1927, Start: 1927, Overview: that works for me um this is a silly observation but um my my son he was 12. he he loves to do like a fake Attenborough voice you know like and now we see the blah blah blah you know like that planet Earth you know very proper narrator so it made me think ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1941, Start: 1941, Overview: know like that planet Earth you know very proper narrator so it made me think of that too but you're right it has a Clive Owen now I can imagine myself I don't know we'll see next thing I know he'll be doing high school presentations by like Chad's GPT plus 11 labs and in the voice of Richard Edinburgh so we'll ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 1970, Start: 1970, Overview: 3D treatment to it so um this is from Firefly and this last shock I was trying to figure out a way to combine um you know the idea of the goal and the minds and like the snow of the Yukon and like the the slight darkness and like ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1981, Start: 1981, Overview: minds and like the snow of the Yukon and like the the slight darkness and like dark rock formation so the rock formation not just the Gen still um special I just typed in rocks cold something like that I can't remember exactly interior cave and did the same thing made a deaf map and ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1996, Start: 1996, Overview: remember exactly interior cave and did the same thing made a deaf map and stable diffusion popped that into 3D and just extruded it and I did the exact same thing with the with the text here from from Firefly so um basically just made just turn it into ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2006, Start: 2006, Overview: from Firefly so um basically just made just turn it into a black and white image and pop the the um the levels on it and that made for a great depth map in itself and then you bring that into um Center 40 and all I'm doing is ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2019, Start: 2019, Overview: bring that into um Center 40 and all I'm doing is they're like again I tried I tried to strip away from any sort of complex animation this is just one layer moving up that's all it is with the camera notification I see I also love the sound effects too in this particular one like ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2030, Start: 2030, Overview: notification I see I also love the sound effects too in this particular one like that crackling like extruding noise I assume that was also your AI sound effects Creator but just really great combo yeah thank you that yeah that was uh that one actually I remember doing that ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2044, Start: 2044, Overview: yeah thank you that yeah that was uh that one actually I remember doing that was in the very first generation it was like oh that's that the Crackle well and just to interject I mean I for folks who weren't here earlier James was making the point that um it felt like a very collaborative process of of going ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2056, Start: 2056, Overview: making the point that um it felt like a very collaborative process of of going back and forth with the AI tools like generating the sound effects or generating you know parts of the script or language and then parts of the vocals but I mean the thing is like obviously folks ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2068, Start: 2068, Overview: but I mean the thing is like obviously folks worry a lot about Job displacement and you know sort of skills being devalued but to me this this is a perfect example of like even if you gave somebody all those tools like most people aren't necessarily going to be able to make ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2082, Start: 2082, Overview: those tools like most people aren't necessarily going to be able to make this in that you have like a whole cinematic vocabulary right I mean you've spent many years clearly like thinking about art and idioms and composition and um that's what makes it work right I mean you can you can synthesize things ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2096, Start: 2096, Overview: um that's what makes it work right I mean you can you can synthesize things in in isolation but like you know anybody can type something in a mid Journey or into Firefly that's great but like bringing it together that to me is is the human skill and and not to put words in your mouth but I can imagine ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2107, Start: 2107, Overview: is the human skill and and not to put words in your mouth but I can imagine this like I I think you maybe said this in text but like this kind of gives you as an individual Creator now the ability to like bring to life your vision because you can have this collaborative ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2119, Start: 2119, Overview: like bring to life your vision because you can have this collaborative relationship right where it's not it's not um okay I only have time to do this one piece of the puzzle is that fair to say that's 100 correct ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2130, Start: 2130, Overview: is that fair to say that's 100 correct um like I mentioned I came up with this idea a long time ago and actually one of the reasons I've learned how to work in 3D was because I wanted to bring this to life back in like 2010. ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2139, Start: 2139, Overview: 3D was because I wanted to bring this to life back in like 2010. um and I made a few shorts um that was like building up to this one thing I want this one to be like the big one and my work involved was just astronomical like you would spend you know a whole weekend making a model that ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2152, Start: 2152, Overview: astronomical like you would spend you know a whole weekend making a model that you didn't end up liking on Monday um and so um I I have sketchbooks Larry with storyboards and files my folder loaded with 3D models that I've come up with um you know I've spent a half a week on ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2165, Start: 2165, Overview: with um you know I've spent a half a week on building like one piece of concept art in 3D and so it was just it was too much it was too much work for me to do on my own and so I thought it was the correct this is a great opportunity to take this idea ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2174, Start: 2174, Overview: and so I thought it was the correct this is a great opportunity to take this idea hand in my head and try all these new tools and smash all together and see what came out and it was actually um a couple insights where I was actually really pleased with how it came ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2183, Start: 2183, Overview: um a couple insights where I was actually really pleased with how it came out I mean there's obviously seams in it but um also I was I felt much more ownership over the project and the process than I would have anticipated um like I feel like these are my images ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2195, Start: 2195, Overview: have anticipated um like I feel like these are my images even though benjamini created them I spent three days with majority creating that and I feel like I gave it enough input I would Photoshop I would photo bash stuff in Photoshop and I would bring that back in the mid journey I ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2204, Start: 2204, Overview: bash stuff in Photoshop and I would bring that back in the mid journey I would combine like five or six images and like make something based on these with this prompt and I went back and forth after a while so I got exactly the images I wanted so yeah and it's a pretty cohesive story and I have a one ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2216, Start: 2216, Overview: images I wanted so yeah and it's a pretty cohesive story and I have a one more question I may have missed this earlier but how much color grading and color reprocessing did you need to do from those raw images to get this or did it just nail that color because it's so cohesive ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2228, Start: 2228, Overview: it just nail that color because it's so cohesive um it's funny you should ask because I probably spent another half a day trying to add more color correction on top was already there but I ended up taking away at the end of the day because like I already got the color correction I ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2241, Start: 2241, Overview: at the end of the day because like I already got the color correction I wanted via the prompts that I used so I built the color correction into the actual prompts for the images and that gave me a really cohesive set of images from the from the get-go so and that's so powerful because like color grading ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2251, Start: 2251, Overview: from the from the get-go so and that's so powerful because like color grading is something that does kind of require like a lot of skill and understanding of kind of theory and it's definitely something where if you you can notice when it's not done correctly so just making it so achievable for anybody to ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2264, Start: 2264, Overview: when it's not done correctly so just making it so achievable for anybody to like get dial that kind of story in so then the clips come together like just so beautifully where it really feels you feel the darkness the richness the Emerald Lake color just really well done um and there's a chat question which is ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2276, Start: 2276, Overview: Emerald Lake color just really well done um and there's a chat question which is what was the total time it took to make this from Carlos yeah so Carlos I have two answers for you um if it was just about the production and actually using the workflow to end ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2289, Start: 2289, Overview: um if it was just about the production and actually using the workflow to end up working for me it was about two weeks um if it also cleared a little trial and error and all the tools I've landed along the way which are more tools and actually using um it was probably closer to three and a ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2303, Start: 2303, Overview: actually using um it was probably closer to three and a half weeks um and so um the actual time it took to create this and that and actually a lot of that even that two weeks was spent because I was using um kind of a finicky render engine in ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2316, Start: 2316, Overview: because I was using um kind of a finicky render engine in Cinema 4D that's kind of known for being unstable so I had a lot of crashes and a lot of waiting so if you were built if you were to build this in a real-time environment which is what I would do in the future ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2328, Start: 2328, Overview: environment which is what I would do in the future it would take a lot less time than that you could probably build something like this in a week if you really kind of just more streamlined and go into full steam ahead cool guys I gotta balance I love you ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2336, Start: 2336, Overview: steam ahead cool guys I gotta balance I love you James that was amazing feel free to keep going obviously rock on thanks everybody for coming I I have to go do my actual job this is thankfully but you know what I mean the 99 participation but I promise you there's some really cool ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2349, Start: 2349, Overview: I mean the 99 participation but I promise you there's some really cool stuff that'll come out of it so it's it's worth going but thanks everybody thanks John we'll be wrapping up here in just a second I do want to share briefly um James I was able to uh do a little Google sleuthing I found your Instagram ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2359, Start: 2359, Overview: um James I was able to uh do a little Google sleuthing I found your Instagram so I'm gonna post it in uh um stage chat here in case anyone wants to find your work um and then yeah I don't know if there's something else anything else you wanted to cover James feel free to do that but ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2370, Start: 2370, Overview: something else anything else you wanted to cover James feel free to do that but I'll just let everyone know we'll start wrapping up here pretty soon um maybe there's one more shock I think there's something kind of magical here that yeah people you exciting to exist because I didn't know it existed ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2381, Start: 2381, Overview: that yeah people you exciting to exist because I didn't know it existed um so like I mentioned earlier like these are all 2D images and you can see how much like 3D space you're getting out of this have a shot moving down into the mine and if you really look closely you can start to see some of the seams ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2394, Start: 2394, Overview: the mine and if you really look closely you can start to see some of the seams like there's like holes in the mesh because you know there's nothing there um stable diffusion currently has a tool where you can and you 3D apply a 2D image it'll try to impaint those holes for you I didn't end up using that ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2407, Start: 2407, Overview: image it'll try to impaint those holes for you I didn't end up using that because it was just for for someone getting into they're just too clunky for me but um so it's pretty incredible like the depth you can get from a single image now ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2419, Start: 2419, Overview: the depth you can get from a single image now um and we're also like experimenting with this in-house as well but the little magical player I wanted to call out here because these characters that are walking here like those are rig 3D ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2427, Start: 2427, Overview: because these characters that are walking here like those are rig 3D characters and I did not rig them or create them in 3D um I used a uh I showed a storyboard earlier and there was just a guy there that I generated from the journey ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2438, Start: 2438, Overview: was just a guy there that I generated from the journey um and there's a hugging phase tool which I can't remember off top of my head right now but you can actually create a 3D character mesh from a 2D image and so again it doesn't do a great job like this these shots are pretty ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2450, Start: 2450, Overview: image and so again it doesn't do a great job like this these shots are pretty dark and so you can't see some of the the um inconsistencies on this character but it's a pretty dang good job like I would use it from now on if I was ever going to create a character and sculpt it ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2462, Start: 2462, Overview: use it from now on if I was ever going to create a character and sculpt it again myself I would start here because it gives you all the cloth if it gives you a lot of detail um and them ideas I just took that 3D mesh and popped it into mix of adobe maximum and that's where I got all these ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2473, Start: 2473, Overview: mesh and popped it into mix of adobe maximum and that's where I got all these animated cycles and so that process took gosh maybe 15 minutes all upset and um um so these are things you could easily do today to like build 3D characters into your into your animations pretty rapidly even if you don't have ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2488, Start: 2488, Overview: into your into your animations pretty rapidly even if you don't have um you know skills with or experience with creating characters or 3D characters from scratch that's really cool James we have one more question from Ted um he's Ted says he said it took about two weeks but what do you ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2499, Start: 2499, Overview: from Ted um he's Ted says he said it took about two weeks but what do you think the timeline would have looked like without Firefly and also by extension generative AI tools oh yeah um over six months in my case like to get ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2510, Start: 2510, Overview: um over six months in my case like to get this level plug the sculpt like a line scene like this for example would have taken me um at least a couple weeks if not more just sculpt it to texture it's um to build the materials for it probably even ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2524, Start: 2524, Overview: just sculpt it to texture it's um to build the materials for it probably even more just for that one scene and even and then you multiply that by 10 scenes um so pretty incredible we're moving or not how quickly we're moving right now yeah it's amazing I can't help but feel like ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2537, Start: 2537, Overview: how quickly we're moving right now yeah it's amazing I can't help but feel like we're gonna see so much more um like quote unquote like amateur Studios or like less funded studios are creative create like really high quality animations or really anything like storytelling I think is just going to be ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2550, Start: 2550, Overview: animations or really anything like storytelling I think is just going to be up level across the board so significantly that I I don't even know in a couple years it's just going to be mind-blowing and this is all in its infancy like all these tools are super experimental and ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2561, Start: 2561, Overview: and this is all in its infancy like all these tools are super experimental and they're fussy and they're temperamental and and the quality you can see where it's going but it's not quite there just yet so I mean think about where we've come in a year like a year ago we were just starting to play with Dolly and ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2573, Start: 2573, Overview: come in a year like a year ago we were just starting to play with Dolly and maternity on our phones and now you can make films with all this stuff so it's just wild yeah I think a lot about 3D like 10 years ago a lot of the 3D tools were not as developed and user friendly and UI friendly as they are today and ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2586, Start: 2586, Overview: were not as developed and user friendly and UI friendly as they are today and now it's like so easy to go into like substance and make beautiful things very easily all the tutorials are there so definitely I can see that same trajectory even faster for AI tooling yeah that's a great Point like right now ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2599, Start: 2599, Overview: trajectory even faster for AI tooling yeah that's a great Point like right now there's a lot of these tools that exist that are really there's really no UI for them at all or ux for them at all like they exist on like a Google polab space you have to basically program it that tells you how ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2611, Start: 2611, Overview: like a Google polab space you have to basically program it that tells you how to program it and you program it and like you're reading you're trying to do the thing and like once the ux um picks up and like once once the technology slows down a little bit and gives ux that time to catch up it's ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 11, Start: 11, Overview: more context so here we are today talking about what are some new creative ideas we can make for our fly more engaging and fun for all of you and we're starting with just um you know creative prompts or you know these prompting challenge that I think most of us are slightly more familiar ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 23, Start: 23, Overview: these prompting challenge that I think most of us are slightly more familiar with and we want to know what are some of the coolest funniest uh prom challenges you've done before or some really bad ideas uh you know it's also great for for learning yeah we probably have some folks here ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 38, Start: 38, Overview: great for for learning yeah we probably have some folks here right now that participate in our um daily themes on Discord or maybe have done kind of the the Firefly ping-pong the layer tennis in round two uh so yeah if anyone has experience with that I'd love to hear you know what about it's ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 55, Start: 55, Overview: if anyone has experience with that I'd love to hear you know what about it's fun and what have been your most favorite prompts uh and then Mike does have a question um Can Firefly allow me to remove individual characters in an image and insert new ones so generate an image and ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 67, Start: 67, Overview: individual characters in an image and insert new ones so generate an image and then I just want to replace this one image or this one character yeah absolutely um so if you you haven't gotten a chance to try it yet um there's the generative fill module ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 79, Start: 79, Overview: to try it yet um there's the generative fill module um I'll grab a link to it here real quick um so I think maybe the answer is like partly so you can definitely go and like paint directly on an image you can um remove things it literally you don't ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 91, Start: 91, Overview: paint directly on an image you can um remove things it literally you don't have to type in anything you just hit return and it will automatically just try to remove um you can also insert things one of the limitations at the moment is um you know you can't like Define a ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 102, Start: 102, Overview: limitations at the moment is um you know you can't like Define a specific character specific entity right so if you always want to put Gus into the scene uh you know you could describe someone with similar characteristics but identity wise it'll it'll vary a little ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 112, Start: 112, Overview: with similar characteristics but identity wise it'll it'll vary a little bit and so like I say that's one of the popular requests um for for enhancing that functionality um I'll drop a link here um ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 124, Start: 124, Overview: um I'll drop a link here um which is now in the chat so that's the end painting module um also if folks here use Photoshop at all uh it's substantially the same Tech in gender to fill in Photoshop of course because things are like messy and it's ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 135, Start: 135, Overview: in gender to fill in Photoshop of course because things are like messy and it's it's a little bit early um there are some slight differences between how it works in each context but um you know if you don't if you haven't yet in Photoshop but you're a Photoshop subscriber you can just go up to the ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 147, Start: 147, Overview: yet in Photoshop but you're a Photoshop subscriber you can just go up to the menu bar there's a little Creative Cloud app you can pull down the beta so we try to keep it separate just so we don't want to screw up you know anything in in your production stuff but it's super easy to download and then once you uh ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 157, Start: 157, Overview: your production stuff but it's super easy to download and then once you uh once you launch it then you'll see generative fill is an option and anyway uh that that's another path to being able to select something and either remove it or to insert something else and like I say ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 168, Start: 168, Overview: remove it or to insert something else and like I say um totally hear you that being able to insert things with more specificity would be um really helpful so Carlos is saying a few fun prompts uh fantasy Foods papercraft space and time ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 181, Start: 181, Overview: so Carlos is saying a few fun prompts uh fantasy Foods papercraft space and time and text words were fun uh text has proven to be fun and challenging to get the right words uh yeah good good feedback um as you guys may obviously know when you synthesize an image not just with firefly but other you know ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 197, Start: 197, Overview: know when you synthesize an image not just with firefly but other you know text to image modules uh for some reason there's there's things that can do brilliantly well and things that it super struggles with and text is has historically been one of the latter I find it kind of charming I mean ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 208, Start: 208, Overview: historically been one of the latter I find it kind of charming I mean obviously we want it to work well but like um particularly like when Dolly came out you get these bizarre hallucinated phrases and um you know in the in the uh text effects module on the Firefly site ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 218, Start: 218, Overview: phrases and um you know in the in the uh text effects module on the Firefly site you can of course uh specify actual text characters and then stylize those um but it'll be cool if we could do it all in one one unified place the the state of the tech is like it's getting there but it's not quite there yet ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 234, Start: 234, Overview: state of the tech is like it's getting there but it's not quite there yet okay well well I see folks are still taking things in I think I would love to show you more of like what we have in mind um bethan are you able to share your screen ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 247, Start: 247, Overview: um bethan are you able to share your screen yeah let me uh there should be a button to share a screen next to your camera option if it's not there oh yeah whenever I'm I think I was discovering ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 266, Start: 266, Overview: oh yeah whenever I'm I think I was discovering that whenever I have Discord full screen it doesn't show the different applications I can share uh but I have figured it out and I'm you make sure I share the right thing classic ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 283, Start: 283, Overview: you make sure I share the right thing classic situation um you can also share the secret stuff and then it's like much more memorable career limiting that way yeah by the way just while you're doing that Mike asked if we've seen a major in a zoom out ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 300, Start: 300, Overview: just while you're doing that Mike asked if we've seen a major in a zoom out capability will you do something similar uh yes um so mid Journey for folks who haven't seen a data the command recently where you know once you synthesize something it's basically like if you were in ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 310, Start: 310, Overview: you know once you synthesize something it's basically like if you were in Photoshop you did um you know you took the crop tool and expanded the canvas then you selected those regions and you filled it in and so you know I'm describing it in those terms because you can do exactly that in ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 320, Start: 320, Overview: so you know I'm describing it in those terms because you can do exactly that in Photoshop today obviously it's not uh as streamlined as just you know saying zoom out but um actually I think yesterday Russell Brown who you may know a long time a w evangelist um put out a set of uh actions for ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 333, Start: 333, Overview: a long time a w evangelist um put out a set of uh actions for Photoshop that make various things easier in fact you can there's a whole digression but you can do things like stylizing an image um just using the generative fill stuff that's in Photoshop so those actions ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 346, Start: 346, Overview: um just using the generative fill stuff that's in Photoshop so those actions make that easier I can easily imagine if if the actions don't already include a sort of zoom out function that's something that we could certainly add using just kind of the building blocks that are already in the ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 358, Start: 358, Overview: certainly add using just kind of the building blocks that are already in the app and so what's neat to see for us is like people um coming up with these like creative applications of the core features we have a good number of folks that just popped in oh I do want to just again ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 374, Start: 374, Overview: we have a good number of folks that just popped in oh I do want to just again highlight um that uh you know today we're discussing fun different Avenues to play around in or have Challenger prompts in Firefly and so if you've been using Firefly and you found things ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 386, Start: 386, Overview: Firefly and so if you've been using Firefly and you found things particularly fun or exciting especially related to the challenges we do on Discord we'd love to hear what those are cool and bethan was you were you able to share your screen I saw it like thinking ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 397, Start: 397, Overview: and bethan was you were you able to share your screen I saw it like thinking but it never actually resolved yeah I I just messaged Candace it looks like I would have to shut down my application and do a whole thing this is um being kind of my first time on this so I was curious if someone else could ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 410, Start: 410, Overview: um being kind of my first time on this so I was curious if someone else could take it this time yeah sure I have the folder open um but do you have the like the sketches in there as well yeah I uploaded all of my stuff cool let me see if I can share ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 423, Start: 423, Overview: yeah I uploaded all of my stuff cool let me see if I can share I put the uh the videos of the designs in the image Basher folder [Music] yeah you know what because I just downloaded my Discord ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 473, Start: 473, Overview: another at another look at the things people have been posting so yeah misspelling I was I think I definitely saw this like misspelled words challenge where you you kind of misspell things and then the results you get are actually pretty Charming um so yes definitely we will keep an eye ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 486, Start: 486, Overview: actually pretty Charming um so yes definitely we will keep an eye on that idea yeah there's all these like classic meme patterns where it's like you know change change a letter ruin a band you know that kind of thing yeah so um yeah that's ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 499, Start: 499, Overview: that kind of thing yeah so um yeah that's uh that that's that that kind of pattern I think is really fun um for folks that are watching you should see a screen now that John sharing um if it's small for you you'll click on it and it'll enlarge it so you ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 511, Start: 511, Overview: sharing um if it's small for you you'll click on it and it'll enlarge it so you can actually see what's going on there okay cool yeah so so I'll I'll pass Mike and I'm happy just tell me which things to click we there's as you can see there's a lot we would love to show you I know we only have a short amount of ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 524, Start: 524, Overview: there's a lot we would love to show you I know we only have a short amount of time but um yeah just just kind of notion is like Adobe is generally really good at like what and and how right like oh well what tools do we need and how should you use them one of the things that we're not usually great at is why ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 537, Start: 537, Overview: should you use them one of the things that we're not usually great at is why like okay but like what would I do with this like why would I use Firefly and and I think we have the opportunity to bring a lot of people into this pretty magical world of generative Imaging um if we give folks like a little bit ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 549, Start: 549, Overview: magical world of generative Imaging um if we give folks like a little bit more of a running start you know a little bit more sort of editorial opinion on like hey the challenge for today is X right and like here's some ingredients you know today we can do that with pump challenges and of course ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 561, Start: 561, Overview: ingredients you know today we can do that with pump challenges and of course all you need is to type something in which is great and we'll certainly keep that going but what's neat is with a tech stack there's suddenly like all these other ingredients that you'll be able to mix in so you may have seen we ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 572, Start: 572, Overview: these other ingredients that you'll be able to mix in so you may have seen we have this project called gingerbread which is all about like mixing in three elements it's like oh if we did that what could we do or you know if you could upload a picture of yourself or your friend then you could apply some ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 582, Start: 582, Overview: could upload a picture of yourself or your friend then you could apply some prompts to that what kind of creative things could you do and then how would we create like interesting challenges and really engaging experiences on top of that so those are the kind of things we're just starting to really explore ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 593, Start: 593, Overview: of that so those are the kind of things we're just starting to really explore and we'd love to get your um get your feedback on so uh bethan do you want to take the mic and I'll I'll drive sure thing um ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 608, Start: 608, Overview: sure thing um I if we go to the first thing um if we go to image mashups okay then we can at least just set some context for some of the stuff we're talking about the things that actually ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 624, Start: 624, Overview: context for some of the stuff we're talking about the things that actually bring the challenges and the the kind of like creative prompting into the experience we're going to show you a little bit that we threw together um let's do image mashup ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 636, Start: 636, Overview: um let's do image mashup the first video yeah okay and should I yeah it's playing can you pause really quick sure okay so this is in the instance that if you think of any sort of classic ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 654, Start: 654, Overview: okay so this is in the instance that if you think of any sort of classic generative AI meme where it is taking one two or more things pushing them together and then creating something that you wouldn't expect or something that you can kind of play around with and tweak and ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 673, Start: 673, Overview: that you can kind of play around with and tweak and um if you were to have something like that and a space to do that in something that is kind of helping you like urging you to do this um there's that level of it so let's you know we can look at that we can play ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 685, Start: 685, Overview: um there's that level of it so let's you know we can look at that we can play really quick and so then yeah classic experience but then if you wanted to go a step further and you want even more creative constraints you don't even know what the first image would be what the second ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 699, Start: 699, Overview: constraints you don't even know what the first image would be what the second image would be and so you kind of need some fun challenge sort of thing that like what this is as an example is uh I've named it Opposites Attract because it is specifically like we'll give you one picture and then your challenge is ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 713, Start: 713, Overview: it is specifically like we'll give you one picture and then your challenge is to think of whatever you think the opposite of that picture is and then you write a prompt to generate that picture and then you get to see what those two things might look like together ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 728, Start: 728, Overview: what those two things might look like together um this is a a pretty simple example of of just like a a general activity like you could picture kind of more game-like things um different prompts but ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 741, Start: 741, Overview: more game-like things um different prompts but uh yeah that's sort of this the type of thing that we're talking about right anything else to add John or Candace uh no not not specifically um so you know if if you go to firefly.w.com we have this little Sizzle reel uh again ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 756, Start: 756, Overview: know if if you go to firefly.w.com we have this little Sizzle reel uh again for March which feels like you know four lifetimes ago but what this is one of the things we kind of touch on is this notion of like hey you take image a b and c and then like let the system take a crack at mashing them together and ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 767, Start: 767, Overview: and c and then like let the system take a crack at mashing them together and like maybe you could play with some parameters but the notion here is like yeah you know we'll give you a hot air balloon think of something else like think of something that would go well with it or something the opposite and ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 777, Start: 777, Overview: think of something that would go well with it or something the opposite and then like what would those look like together and then these are real results you know from the tech just mashing up those two those two images um and then you know this is the kind of ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 787, Start: 787, Overview: images um and then you know this is the kind of thing where we just want to like start wetting your appetite about okay if you had these Frameworks and they tap into the tech uh in a more directed way you know what are some of the fun challenges that that might result ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 798, Start: 798, Overview: you know what are some of the fun challenges that that might result should I go to the next vid sure um and then this is an example um just another example of us kind of providing some structure providing the things that kind of gets your creative ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 813, Start: 813, Overview: providing some structure providing the things that kind of gets your creative juices flowing and this one is more about like if we were to provide you three different things then you have to think about what to assemble so yeah we can just watch it it's okay um I know they're all ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 827, Start: 827, Overview: what to assemble so yeah we can just watch it it's okay um I know they're all super quick so so yeah you're picking yeah ingredients and then letting it generate it says robot reading listening to music colorful stars I think yeah let me let it play again because it's so quick so yeah it's like ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 841, Start: 841, Overview: yeah let me let it play again because it's so quick so yeah it's like so as I understand it like you the either you the human could go pick images or you know we can kind of like slot machine these together and then right they populate and it's like I either like this let me see what would ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 853, Start: 853, Overview: right they populate and it's like I either like this let me see what would happen or you know let me swap one out or let me roll again and I could get three new ones then based on that input you can let the algorithm take a crack at it and you know mix in your own prompt ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 864, Start: 864, Overview: at it and you know mix in your own prompt um and that might be part of the fun it's just like being creative with like okay you know maybe you're stuck with these three ingredients but you know the degree of freedom is the prompt like we ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 871, Start: 871, Overview: three ingredients but you know the degree of freedom is the prompt like we could kind of play with those different sort of like game mechanics and then you let it run you hit generate and then you get these like four up kind of interesting compositions taking those three ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 880, Start: 880, Overview: like four up kind of interesting compositions taking those three ingredients plus what you added to it yeah and I I threw it up there as as a really kind of Scrappy approach to it but if you look and see the the little thingy that says inspo how would you combine this image ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 895, Start: 895, Overview: thingy that says inspo how would you combine this image um these image ingredients to make an album cover um whether it's that way or not um that could be another tier of if you're just sitting there and you don't know what to do ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 906, Start: 906, Overview: sitting there and you don't know what to do um some something within the experience to kind of just start shooting different ideas out at you and help you kind of think okay if I'm within this context if I have to think within this or ooh that idea I didn't think about that now I'm ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 917, Start: 917, Overview: I have to think within this or ooh that idea I didn't think about that now I'm thinking of something it's building and stuff like that yeah and we're playing with Notions like you know if things can be sort of like recognizably within a genre then it's sort of fun to see how other people Riff ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 930, Start: 930, Overview: recognizably within a genre then it's sort of fun to see how other people Riff on it uh maybe just I know just always be mindful of time I told you guys this would go way faster than uh than we ever expect uh let me go up a level and show you some of the other things we've we've ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 939, Start: 939, Overview: expect uh let me go up a level and show you some of the other things we've we've been looking at so um I'm gonna go to gingerbread and um so you know 3D is is an amazing thing is usually inherently pretty intimidating ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 952, Start: 952, Overview: you know 3D is is an amazing thing is usually inherently pretty intimidating to most people even to me like there's so many things I could get get wrong what's cool at gingerbread is really it's just an ingredient that you're mixing into image creation so you're just taking ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 963, Start: 963, Overview: mixing into image creation so you're just taking um some primitive you know like it could be a ball it could be a donut shape it could be whatever and then uh you're just describing the scene that you want to see so you don't have to swim around with like textures and ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 974, Start: 974, Overview: you want to see so you don't have to swim around with like textures and lighting and all the stuff that's like makes 3D inherently complicated this is an example where you know I just dragged in this little Taurus shape right the donut I was like oh what is what does that look like what ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 982, Start: 982, Overview: Taurus shape right the donut I was like oh what is what does that look like what could I think of and I was like oh what if it was a bunch of delicious uh jelly donuts um let me see if I can go image damage uh oh come on Microsoft uh and then I was ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 991, Start: 991, Overview: let me see if I can go image damage uh oh come on Microsoft uh and then I was like well what if it was interpreted differently so same exact same layout but I just gave it a different prompt and I was like oh make it a bunch of inner tubes sitting you know alongside a river or around the water ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1002, Start: 1002, Overview: inner tubes sitting you know alongside a river or around the water and so you could imagine a creative challenge where uh maybe we come in and we're like hey here are one two or three shapes that you can use and then you know you come up with like what do you think ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1016, Start: 1016, Overview: know you come up with like what do you think would be the most creative application of those um you know in my case I chose Donuts um and then just to have fun with it after I made those I clicked okay open this in general to fill I clicked one ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1024, Start: 1024, Overview: after I made those I clicked okay open this in general to fill I clicked one more button to automatically select the background and then I said you know inner tubes on water or Donuts on Water I forget exactly the problem but it just generated all these interesting variations uh based on top of that ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1036, Start: 1036, Overview: generated all these interesting variations uh based on top of that Donuts yeah and I think there was a question like can you get the meshes out so I should be clear no so there is there is technology into development which is text to 3D where you're actually you know synthesizing messages ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1048, Start: 1048, Overview: which is text to 3D where you're actually you know synthesizing messages this is kind of going the opposite way it's 3D to image and so it's saying it's one of the things you know you could do a 2d sketch you could do a 3D object those things are just um giving some constraints to Firefly ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1058, Start: 1058, Overview: those things are just um giving some constraints to Firefly you're like oh I specifically want things here here and here but then you're you're still bringing in the prompt has like a high level concept and and so let me show you another potentially interesting application of ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1069, Start: 1069, Overview: and so let me show you another potentially interesting application of that so um again with with just these these simple things I was thinking well okay what what could I do using just that sort of donut shape and maybe I just add in a ball and as I ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1083, Start: 1083, Overview: do using just that sort of donut shape and maybe I just add in a ball and as I was rotating I was like oh that kind of actually looks like a sea creature in the water so let me just kind of like drag the this around give them a head uh typed in an intimidating sea monster rising from a dark and stormy sea hit ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1097, Start: 1097, Overview: typed in an intimidating sea monster rising from a dark and stormy sea hit generate thinks about it for a few seconds and now I have the same answer right and and so you could go among these now I didn't put in any constraints around like style obviously all that stuff you could layer ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1109, Start: 1109, Overview: put in any constraints around like style obviously all that stuff you could layer in additionally but really again you're just kind of giving Firefly more of an intentional starting place and so then the challenge experiences could be you know like yeah we it's almost think of like Iron Chef ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1121, Start: 1121, Overview: experiences could be you know like yeah we it's almost think of like Iron Chef you know it's like all right we're gonna give you some paprika some mayonnaise and some kale or like oh I can't I can't cook right but like some small number of ingredients and then you see the chef's creativity come out based on ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1134, Start: 1134, Overview: ingredients and then you see the chef's creativity come out based on um based on that challenge right so there's another example with the uh the sea monster and so somebody's asking what software so this is something we haven't released it's it's basically just a little ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1145, Start: 1145, Overview: so this is something we haven't released it's it's basically just a little experimental mode of firefly that we're thinking about where uh one of the ingredients that you can mix in alongside text and styles is uh geometry but again trying to keep it really simple it's not supposed to be my or ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1158, Start: 1158, Overview: but again trying to keep it really simple it's not supposed to be my or Blend or anything like that you're just supposed to be able to like populate a scene with a couple of simple ships oh I see some donuts appearing I don't believe okay that actually looks really good and I would like to know how you ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1167, Start: 1167, Overview: believe okay that actually looks really good and I would like to know how you made that uh all right I think there's a donut Emoji but uh I can't find it the second all right I keep rocking if uh uh you know Candace Bethany got other stuff please please throw her in there um otherwise I'm just gonna keep rocking ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1182, Start: 1182, Overview: please please throw her in there um otherwise I'm just gonna keep rocking um here's one uh oh go ahead yeah so sorry for you to see if there was going to be time to just mention the hide and seek one ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1196, Start: 1196, Overview: time to just mention the hide and seek one um yeah totally I mean I don't think there's any hard limit it's just you know I know people have to you guys might have other meetings we gotta bounce but yeah uh let we can do that just a second since I happen to have ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1206, Start: 1206, Overview: bounce but yeah uh let we can do that just a second since I happen to have this up so this is Davis uh Russell signing happens to also be an amazing designer he's working on Photoshop and uh just selected everything but his face right so what you'll see image after image is he um he kept that constant but ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1218, Start: 1218, Overview: right so what you'll see image after image is he um he kept that constant but then they just varied the prompts and so it was like here it's like a man happily you know on vacation in Hawaii um then it was like here's a man you know eating pizza in Chicago uh you know here's a man ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 1243, Start: 1243, Overview: Paris and so you can see it's always the same face it's always the same guy the only thing that's changing is the selection or sorry not even the selection but just the prompt and then based on that you can get these really visually different ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1252, Start: 1252, Overview: the prompt and then based on that you can get these really visually different results so you know you can imagine a a challenge which is like all right you know take a picture of yourself and like go on a virtual vacation you know what would that look like um another treatment might be ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1263, Start: 1263, Overview: would that look like um another treatment might be um where do I have it uh verification like someone a statue so you can imagine something where it's like you could you could start with having an image so here you know happening to have this this ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1275, Start: 1275, Overview: could start with having an image so here you know happening to have this this picture of this woman um and based on that you could say like okay I actually want to uh turn her into a bronze statue like how would that look so again you know in the one case we were using 3D as an ingredient here ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1289, Start: 1289, Overview: so again you know in the one case we were using 3D as an ingredient here we're using a photo as an ingredient plus the prompt and then you could say like well that's cool but like what if there was a Mad Libs sort of interface where it's like well now you know I I the only thing I'm going to change is ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1299, Start: 1299, Overview: where it's like well now you know I I the only thing I'm going to change is the ingredients so instead of being bronze it's going to be you know she's made of chocolate or you know maybe I'll go back and uh here she's actually made of marble um so it's a result like that ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1312, Start: 1312, Overview: of marble um so it's a result like that um but sorry Bethany did you wanna you wanna talk about the hide and seek idea well um I guess I won't go into too much detail about it I saw someone in the chat kind of even throughout just even ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1325, Start: 1325, Overview: detail about it I saw someone in the chat kind of even throughout just even hearing that maybe said this like reverse I Spy game like that's that's basically getting at it um there's lots of different options but I'd be curious to just know how people would feel up about challenges like that like if there ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1338, Start: 1338, Overview: to just know how people would feel up about challenges like that like if there was something that kind of it challenged you to add more detail to prompts so that you're hiding something or like a co-creator had to find it or anything that's around that that is both fun and a game but also kind of helping you ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1352, Start: 1352, Overview: that's around that that is both fun and a game but also kind of helping you navigate um how to create better prompts like it's skill building and fun um I just be curious to know if there's um interest in that when it comes to usefulness and I don't know and building ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1369, Start: 1369, Overview: um interest in that when it comes to usefulness and I don't know and building skills or just having fun as its own usefulness in general yeah I think that was a it was very long-winded question and maybe there's a way I can uh ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 233, Start: 233, Overview: squares um if other people are having trouble let me know just speak up in the chat um so I I mentioned that in the context of these uh feature requests so that oh where do they go anyway uh it's around here but but suffice it to say you know please please do upvote things so the ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 246, Start: 246, Overview: here but but suffice it to say you know please please do upvote things so the second most popular thing which is now becoming the number one thing if you if you think we've kind of addressed first one is uploading a reference this image to guide the the process of making stuff ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 261, Start: 261, Overview: this image to guide the the process of making stuff and so that's where this control net stuff comes in and so really there's uh there's a bunch of ways uh you can get more controls one is just like physically where things can go so you might notice with these AI image ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 273, Start: 273, Overview: physically where things can go so you might notice with these AI image creation modules or models sometimes they're not super precise like they're they're really bad at counting and they're sometimes bad at like spatial positioning and they're you know putting ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 284, Start: 284, Overview: sometimes bad at like spatial positioning and they're you know putting like you know a red circle on a blue box on a green horseshoe or something they they totally get the layout wrong so as a human obviously you know what you meant and if you could just give it a little bit more control about where ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 295, Start: 295, Overview: meant and if you could just give it a little bit more control about where things go that would be really powerful the other thing that would be powerful is to be able to use um various images for styling and so being able to reference like Starry Night ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 305, Start: 305, Overview: being able to reference like Starry Night from Van Gogh for example and get like the colors and maybe some of the brush qualities would be would be pretty amazing so let me show you what that might look like so uh let me take this uh you know King's Lair ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 318, Start: 318, Overview: might look like so uh let me take this uh you know King's Lair vikingata so this is a real photo uh I should uh mention so up in the upper right you've got this input image that's something you can't do in the Firefly site today but in a don't don't take any of this you UI design uh super seriously ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 331, Start: 331, Overview: site today but in a don't don't take any of this you UI design uh super seriously just because it's all works in progress It's really kind of meant for internal testing but based on that image input and a bunch of text and say uh kingslayer from ancient Viking yada yada ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 346, Start: 346, Overview: kingslayer from ancient Viking yada yada you know dim by fire good architecture and so now you can see you have a lot more control over ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 362, Start: 362, Overview: have a lot more control over the structure of what um you're gonna get but you can start mixing those parameters the also the cool thing is you'll see under these ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 372, Start: 372, Overview: mixing those parameters the also the cool thing is you'll see under these image conditions um there's history brain making sense of math but essentially you know they're leveraging the you know to then mixing with the generative process so it's the same settings but now you're ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 386, Start: 386, Overview: then mixing with the generative process so it's the same settings but now you're starting to get this like really cool like thick gloopy uh paint texture and color palette applied to the image so really it's not fundamentally changing what image creation is it's just giving a lot more Precision to hopefully make ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 399, Start: 399, Overview: what image creation is it's just giving a lot more Precision to hopefully make it more uh precise and personal and so um you know feel free you know jump in comments questions as I go um the other another really powerful thing you can do is use this oh my God ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 410, Start: 410, Overview: um the other another really powerful thing you can do is use this oh my God by the way I always say like when I'm on my deathbed I will be uh I will be hearing the the little demo stock music we have in our videos and I will also be imagining all of these login screens because this is my life uh sorry I I ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 425, Start: 425, Overview: imagining all of these login screens because this is my life uh sorry I I think it's it's because we have these different builds internally oh please don't not work um bear with me so now's a good time to compose any thoughts or questions if you ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 442, Start: 442, Overview: bear with me so now's a good time to compose any thoughts or questions if you can um and if this doesn't work I am not offline robot uh what um because I did did the Julia Child trick of like ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 464, Start: 464, Overview: um because I did did the Julia Child trick of like pre-generating stuff yeah go ahead all right let's trip for this one more time and all right if the Friday demo gods are with ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 492, Start: 492, Overview: all right if the Friday demo gods are with us log in if they're not we'll just cut over two to some of the baked output and I'll show you ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 506, Start: 506, Overview: to some of the baked output and I'll show you 3D stones also cool so again the 3D um pack is is conceptually similar right you're just using four methods to guide the process then you would have simply by text or text plus some success so hopefully people find it like a very ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 524, Start: 524, Overview: by text or text plus some success so hopefully people find it like a very natural incremental evolution and thank you lawyers for making us put in like 19 levels of that stuff all right so here's here's why cool ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 540, Start: 540, Overview: stuff all right so here's here's why cool um what else we heard we did search uh um white guys but there's a lot of farmers who are not middle-aged white guys and so sometimes um you know what you you have in your mind's eye or what you can get through ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 552, Start: 552, Overview: um you know what you you have in your mind's eye or what you can get through something like stock isn't as rich as as what you'd want so a cool uh technique you can use here is using a starting image I don't know if this came specifically from stock it probably did ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 564, Start: 564, Overview: if this came specifically from stock it probably did uh and now you're getting a bunch of guys who are conditioned on this this in input image you know with similar posts similar demographics but as you'd imagine you can then start varying the properties of that so if I say a photo ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 576, Start: 576, Overview: imagine you can then start varying the properties of that so if I say a photo of an older oh man on a farm sunny day it's going to mix that problem ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 592, Start: 592, Overview: sunny day it's going to mix that problem because you'd expect image anything and now instead of having or this dude you have these ladies and these powerful way it's also um good way to um you know get you know get the more the range of ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 613, Start: 613, Overview: um you know get you know get the more the range of options that you would want in in imagery um obviously this stuff gets um gets touchy just be honest like in some of the testing there's there's things people are comfortable with in terms of ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 624, Start: 624, Overview: of the testing there's there's things people are comfortable with in terms of transforms or Generations things are not um anything around you know changing people's ethnicity changing gender can be sensitive so here honestly getting guidance from you guys and and from other uh customers is super important ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 635, Start: 635, Overview: guidance from you guys and and from other uh customers is super important right we want this stuff to feel good because I think people's hearts are in the right place um and sometimes you know maybe instead of having a you know a photo of a real individual uh that's then seeming to be ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 646, Start: 646, Overview: of having a you know a photo of a real individual uh that's then seeming to be transformed maybe it would be you know better if that was just like a mannequin right or it's kind of a blurry depth map again technologically it's doing the same thing but you know if that feels less weird we should talk about that ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 658, Start: 658, Overview: same thing but you know if that feels less weird we should talk about that um because obviously we want one folks to be comfortable with this uh let me um upload an image and like give me one second I just gotta find it on my um on my desktop so somebody's asking ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 671, Start: 671, Overview: um on my desktop so somebody's asking um so can you talk about control net implementation is it still secret so it is unreleased the fact that I'm saying it right now means it's it's not secret in the sense that like we're starting to talk about it you know for some weeks ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 684, Start: 684, Overview: in the sense that like we're starting to talk about it you know for some weeks I've been talking about the fact that we want to do this and uh and and we're certainly experimenting with it um let me just pull this up so you don't have to uh look at nothing while while ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 693, Start: 693, Overview: let me just pull this up so you don't have to uh look at nothing while while we go um but uh yeah here's here's an example where you're taking you know one photograph and if all you want to do is is style transfer this can be a really ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 705, Start: 705, Overview: photograph and if all you want to do is is style transfer this can be a really powerful way to do that um so yeah definitely not a secret that we're working on this stuff um one of the one of the many challenges we ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 715, Start: 715, Overview: um one of the one of the many challenges we have is we're trying to take what we have already in market and get that to a lot more people um stay tuned there's some really really exciting news coming there um we're also trying to bring it to more ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 725, Start: 725, Overview: exciting news coming there um we're also trying to bring it to more product surfaces um again stay tuned like very very soon uh some some cool stuff to tell you about um and at the same time we're also trying to make it deeper and so as you'd ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 736, Start: 736, Overview: um and at the same time we're also trying to make it deeper and so as you'd imagine these things are are somewhat in conflict with each other but um but here you can see you know just taking this image from Greece you can get some cool styling uh here I found the image I wanted to to show so ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 746, Start: 746, Overview: get some cool styling uh here I found the image I wanted to to show so um there's this famous image from you know the I think the 20s and uh I want to use that as an input and I want to say uh young uh excitedly uh excitedly yelling ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 763, Start: 763, Overview: excitedly uh excitedly yelling and you'd imagine right to get this particular pose just using text would be really hard now uh as you can see it is not ready to ship uh you get some pretty freaky results um and there's there's a lot of tuning ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 784, Start: 784, Overview: uh you get some pretty freaky results um and there's there's a lot of tuning to be done but the point is we're introducing the ability to specify more control more ingredients that you can then start to mix together another thing you can do is then to start mixing in specific individuals which gets gets ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 798, Start: 798, Overview: you can do is then to start mixing in specific individuals which gets gets really uh interesting so um let me just well I don't know I was going to try to pull up a picture of of my boss's boss uh let's go ahead and do that um ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 813, Start: 813, Overview: that um uh so uh head of AI uh Alexander costume uh just to give you a sense of what he looks like in real life it's this guy and he's really been the driving force between you know around a lot of what we've been doing with generative Imaging ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 827, Start: 827, Overview: between you know around a lot of what we've been doing with generative Imaging over these last months and years and so all right so kind of snapshot that face um so Alexandria and some of the other execs um at Adobe have had their images um ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 839, Start: 839, Overview: um at Adobe have had their images um brought in and done custom Training and so let me now imagine we want this farmer but instead of it just being some random guy in a field I want it actually to be Alexandria so let's give that a shot and ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 852, Start: 852, Overview: to be Alexandria so let's give that a shot and um so down here from my actors I'm going to choose Alexandria and it is obviously a little slower um you know much such is the way of uh running things not in production um so this might take a little bit of ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 866, Start: 866, Overview: running things not in production um so this might take a little bit of time but really this is sort of conceptually similar to what you would get via apps where you can like make an AI Avatar right you go select 5 10 uh 15 selfies whatever the right number is and you know in those ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 878, Start: 878, Overview: select 5 10 uh 15 selfies whatever the right number is and you know in those cases they're they're then just kind of like making a scene that doesn't necessarily um have much control for you but it gives you you know 20 different avatars or 200 or whatever ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 890, Start: 890, Overview: gives you you know 20 different avatars or 200 or whatever um and so what you're seeing here is again based on this guy instead of compositionally uh with this pose with the stuff in the background it's a sunny day and now um you know Alexandria as you know over ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 902, Start: 902, Overview: day and now um you know Alexandria as you know over here is being featured as one of the actors uh in the scene right so uh folks are asking like can I can I get it this now uh no is a short answer um you know keep your fingers crossed we can get it into your hands as soon as ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 917, Start: 917, Overview: um you know keep your fingers crossed we can get it into your hands as soon as possible like I say there's still plenty of like fine tuning around the quality that we want to do to make it um make it more useful but we we want to get it in your hands so you can guide us like hey how good is it do you want it you know ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 929, Start: 929, Overview: your hands so you can guide us like hey how good is it do you want it you know tuned uh further and uh Outlook to not bother me which would be great okay so let me just show you um some of the other output uh you can get so ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 942, Start: 942, Overview: some of the other output uh you can get so um here's uh David bloodwani one of our other execs uh this is you know sort of more impressive if you know the people individually but again just by by uh taking In His Image I don't think in this case I even used a specific ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 955, Start: 955, Overview: taking In His Image I don't think in this case I even used a specific um Exemplar but but those are you know independent ingredients uh here's Eli this is a little bit more weird he's another of our our leads um but again you know tapping him as one of the actors you can get these results ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 967, Start: 967, Overview: um but again you know tapping him as one of the actors you can get these results and here I took that same constructivist image I just wanted to do some mutations with the um the color palette but I also thought well can I make a realistic human using that same image and the answer was yeah pretty realistic again ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 982, Start: 982, Overview: human using that same image and the answer was yeah pretty realistic again there's there's some artifacts there's work to be done but um you know kind of pick the characteristics of the person you're looking for and you can get them in that that pose ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 993, Start: 993, Overview: looking for and you can get them in that that pose which we think you know again super powerful but like you know please tell us what you think what what's what of these things is most valuable what's like less interesting um that's all really really good for us ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1003, Start: 1003, Overview: like less interesting um that's all really really good for us um and you already saw this but there's Alexandria uh here's one I really like where I just took this um if I can get it but uh basically I can't get it to zoom ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1014, Start: 1014, Overview: if I can get it but uh basically I can't get it to zoom but you get the idea I've just got to some like black and white line art and uh then applied um different coloring different prompts you can imagine or at least I I can imagine this being super powerful like if you're doing logo ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1030, Start: 1030, Overview: least I I can imagine this being super powerful like if you're doing logo design you know you basically just like got a black and white logo and you want to do uh some cool things in fact um if you've attended previous ones so this was a an external implementation of ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1040, Start: 1040, Overview: um if you've attended previous ones so this was a an external implementation of control net um that I was playing with and just like taking logos you know like I would take this you know railroad logo and you know can I turn it into something interesting you know different color different ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1054, Start: 1054, Overview: can I turn it into something interesting you know different color different texture um probably my favorite one is just taking some very simple uh line art from stock site and you know turning it into these different transformed results um so you know if you're interested in ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1066, Start: 1066, Overview: these different transformed results um so you know if you're interested in playing with the stuff today just look up control net um I can try to like paste a link to a cool prototype in fact let me just do that um I always try to give credit where ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1076, Start: 1076, Overview: that um I always try to give credit where it's due um sorry get to see all my my bookmark chaos um and I I don't know who to credit uh with ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1087, Start: 1087, Overview: um and I I don't know who to credit uh with this but it's it's really cool um in fact so so play with that one and I love this other project somebody did where they they took logos and they used these techniques to do things like you ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1101, Start: 1101, Overview: where they they took logos and they used these techniques to do things like you know take the Starbucks logo and then get the sort of Nicole Kidman photorealistic or Illustrated version uh or you know I think I like this one most uh take Burger King and turn it into an actual burger with like dripping sauce ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1118, Start: 1118, Overview: uh take Burger King and turn it into an actual burger with like dripping sauce and lettuce like super crazy stuff so again like getting the actual Burger King logo particularly in Firefly which isn't trained on you know these copyrighted images would be essentially possible uh if you just were were typing ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1131, Start: 1131, Overview: copyrighted images would be essentially possible uh if you just were were typing text and sometimes you know we meet people who've generated like tens or hundreds or thousands of images with uh various uh generative models and you know that's cool I hope they're having fun but it takes a lot of time ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1145, Start: 1145, Overview: and you know that's cool I hope they're having fun but it takes a lot of time and a lot of storage and I'm going and finding things and so if you could just have more Precision during the process we think that'd be amazing okay uh like I say time is kind of Blowing by uh let me show you the 3D stuff because ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1156, Start: 1156, Overview: like I say time is kind of Blowing by uh let me show you the 3D stuff because that's super cool too so um and then if if time permits anyone hang out I can uh um I can take requests because I have a build running but in the interest of time uh let me just go ahead and play ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1169, Start: 1169, Overview: build running but in the interest of time uh let me just go ahead and play but sorry I'm kind of showing the output first but I'll give you a sense of what what we've got cooking so call it gingerbread because uh you know that that's the demo version that we have on the website so ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1180, Start: 1180, Overview: because uh you know that that's the demo version that we have on the website so here the idea is like well I want to build up a city I want to have it have a very kind of specific uh orientation you know I want to have like this drone shot look again you could describe that in text but if you can give it more cues ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1193, Start: 1193, Overview: look again you could describe that in text but if you can give it more cues that's pretty powerful and so um under the hood What's Happening Here is you're making a depth map so because you know we know how far away all the objects are we know we can basically it's like a black and white channel uh ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1204, Start: 1204, Overview: objects are we know we can basically it's like a black and white channel uh let me pause this because I'm maybe do it justice um and so just by looking at essentially like the black and white values for distance you can then feed those into ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1214, Start: 1214, Overview: like the black and white values for distance you can then feed those into the process along with here it says skyscrapers in Chicago next to the river and you go ahead and let that run and it thinks about it and you know you're getting multiple versions um sometimes the quality is is pretty ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1226, Start: 1226, Overview: getting multiple versions um sometimes the quality is is pretty amazing sometimes it's a little bit wobbly again this is all the kind of stuff that we're working on but um experience wise you can see you've got all of these just like very simple primitive shapes and ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1236, Start: 1236, Overview: all of these just like very simple primitive shapes and um team title of this different version all right all right and now here's another one I made which uh I was I was playing with this sort of sea monster and you know because I'm ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1250, Start: 1250, Overview: uh I was I was playing with this sort of sea monster and you know because I'm such a noob when it comes to 3D I was like what are the simplest things I could play with there's a donut and there's a ball all right but when you play with the Donut oh shoot that was weird ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1261, Start: 1261, Overview: play with the Donut oh shoot that was weird oh really oh oh okay that's yeah let me just restart QuickTime Player I don't know it seems all right I'm always amazed that any of this stuff ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1277, Start: 1277, Overview: I don't know it seems all right I'm always amazed that any of this stuff works ever uh but it doesn't work always all right sorry it's giving me quick time Mary's [Music] um but did did you see the one with the ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1291, Start: 1291, Overview: um but did did you see the one with the city did that at least play oh oh I'm sorry guys please please holler holler holler sooner let me all right if it doesn't work I'll just show you in my browser but it is trust me ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1309, Start: 1309, Overview: right if it doesn't work I'll just show you in my browser but it is trust me it's really cool um but I think there must be a conflict between Quicktime and screen sharing with Discord um ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1321, Start: 1321, Overview: with Discord um so I'll bring up a recent all right are you seeing this little box moving around no are you still just seeing the blog huh all right okay all right let me do this ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1336, Start: 1336, Overview: huh all right okay all right let me do this um okay so I had I'll I'll bring them next time I had some uh how about now are you seeing are you seeing a world with like yeah okay okay wait you said the blog or you see like actual like 3D shapes and ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1351, Start: 1351, Overview: okay okay wait you said the blog or you see like actual like 3D shapes and things okay cool all right all right so I will try I will try to replicate this and again sorry that that last thing probably didn't make a ton of sense um without without seeing what I was trying ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1364, Start: 1364, Overview: um without without seeing what I was trying to to show but um yeah so the idea is you're you're using these um you know very very simple objects uh here I think I made two copies let me ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1374, Start: 1374, Overview: you know very very simple objects uh here I think I made two copies let me try that again um to um Define what's in the scene so conceptually it's it's very much like what I was showing with using a photo ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1385, Start: 1385, Overview: conceptually it's it's very much like what I was showing with using a photo um it just happens to be using these 3D objects and so uh let's see if I can scale this guy and I'm just going to duplicate that yeah here all right you can you can readily tell why I was ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1404, Start: 1404, Overview: here all right you can you can readily tell why I was uh I was trying to go with the pre-canned version um so I couldn't make too many mistakes um but let me uh let me know say like uh uh ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1420, Start: 1420, Overview: let me know say like uh uh so I'm saying an impressive sea monster on an angry ocean see how it goes and keep your fingers crossed uh we'll get something cool uh and if we don't I promise I'll come back next week and I'll show you how it's supposed to look ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1440, Start: 1440, Overview: promise I'll come back next week and I'll show you how it's supposed to look uh I also have some like baked output versions um oh okay all right hopefully you're seeing some some sea monsters something like let's see monster-ish ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1450, Start: 1450, Overview: seeing some some sea monsters something like let's see monster-ish um and so uh just by you know putting in these like incredibly dirt simple shapes like a donut and a ball uh and then giving it the idea of what I want to see I'm able to get ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1462, Start: 1462, Overview: giving it the idea of what I want to see I'm able to get I don't know some like kind of interesting compositions so you know as you keep hearing me repeat there's a ton of of you know uh refinement and additional power we want to get into ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1475, Start: 1475, Overview: uh refinement and additional power we want to get into um but even with this you know this is this is I think still pretty fun um you know here was uh my my OG attempt at this and I got this result pretty quick ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1487, Start: 1487, Overview: at this and I got this result pretty quick um this to me is like a pretty impressive and painterly sometimes the results are like less so but again that's that's why we're we're not shipping yet we want to refine it we want to get in your hands ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1498, Start: 1498, Overview: shipping yet we want to refine it we want to get in your hands um here I was like literally just taking an armchair and putting a a pumpkin on top of it um here I put in like a ghost and um and a snowman again some of these visuals not great but but you get the ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1507, Start: 1507, Overview: and a snowman again some of these visuals not great but but you get the core idea right which is like whether you're using a photograph you're using a sketch you're using a 3D object all of these things are just more ingredients to give you more power and more more control over ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1519, Start: 1519, Overview: to give you more power and more more control over um the compositions and the outputs that you get and um yeah well by next week uh I'll definitely have more to show you because ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1529, Start: 1529, Overview: yeah well by next week uh I'll definitely have more to show you because I couldn't show you some of it today but um yeah hopefully interesting any any quick thoughts questions stuff before uh before we wrap I go full Om Nom Nom mode lately uh hopefully that's the uh let's see ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1542, Start: 1542, Overview: I go full Om Nom Nom mode lately uh hopefully that's the uh let's see monster oh shoot see I want those back yeah again um Let me let me just see what happens this time if I refresh at least they were hopefully recorded ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1553, Start: 1553, Overview: this time if I refresh at least they were hopefully recorded um I'm sure no no no so so all the training we do is uh on Adobe stock and um ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1575, Start: 1575, Overview: on Adobe stock and um like public domain uh sources so there's there's a lot of like sort of different buckets and there's also a lot of retraining that goes on but the the tldr is like no we're not training on on the stuff you ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1587, Start: 1587, Overview: goes on but the the tldr is like no we're not training on on the stuff you share with us and then there's also so are you working on Scribble as well yeah so that's a whole other thing maybe next week I can show some of those experiments I always have to you know make sure the engineers ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1597, Start: 1597, Overview: show some of those experiments I always have to you know make sure the engineers and and teams are are cool with sharing stuff but yeah I think another great modality would you know is just um you know instead of having to upload an image or a photo um from from externally you could you ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1608, Start: 1608, Overview: an image or a photo um from from externally you could you know conceivably just like draw something there and it's like oh you know I want the blue region to be wider I want the green region to be grass you know make me a composition based on that so there's a ton of ways you could think ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1618, Start: 1618, Overview: know make me a composition based on that so there's a ton of ways you could think about um exploring the possibilities uh does Firefly uh know what some Pokemon are I I would not expect so um you know you all might have tried this but if you type in like Mickey Mouse ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1633, Start: 1633, Overview: you know you all might have tried this but if you type in like Mickey Mouse like you'll get something but it's not going to be the Mickey Mouse you expected and that's an intentional design decision because you know we're just not training on that data because it's copyright and there therefore it's ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1642, Start: 1642, Overview: just not training on that data because it's copyright and there therefore it's not in stock um but this is the interesting angle and something I should probably touch on by using these various sort of control net powered techniques obviously you can then start bringing in things like you ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1654, Start: 1654, Overview: powered techniques obviously you can then start bringing in things like you could bring in a 3D Mickey Mouse if you wanted to right um or you could bring in you know an arbitrary image part of why we didn't start there is um the ethics get a little bit murkier just because it's like well okay if I'm ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1667, Start: 1667, Overview: um the ethics get a little bit murkier just because it's like well okay if I'm uploading my own photo that I took of course like I took that and I can do with it what I want yeah you know maybe if I take um you know a van Gogh right that's you know it's it's not somebody who's alive the image is is well known ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1678, Start: 1678, Overview: that's you know it's it's not somebody who's alive the image is is well known you know that's like ethically cool if I want to like kind of get that color palette if however you know I'm downloading something from a living artist who's trying to make a living and I'm using that to condition my ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1689, Start: 1689, Overview: artist who's trying to make a living and I'm using that to condition my composition that starts to get a little a little uh touchier um so I think we don't have like bulletproof Technical Solutions for sort of determining who owns what and making sure you can only do things with like ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1701, Start: 1701, Overview: of determining who owns what and making sure you can only do things with like certain stuff I'm guessing what we'll end up with and again we we could really use your input on this because we'll probably just put things in the UI which encourage people to be mindful you know to respect the IP of ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1713, Start: 1713, Overview: in the UI which encourage people to be mindful you know to respect the IP of other people um to try to do the right thing you know in specific cases like if it's a download from Adobe stock well then we know where it came from and you know we can Surface something and be like hey if ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1724, Start: 1724, Overview: know where it came from and you know we can Surface something and be like hey if you want to use this you know you need to purchase it so that the Creator gets paid um but if it's just some you know random image somebody downloaded then you know ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1733, Start: 1733, Overview: but if it's just some you know random image somebody downloaded then you know it's uh it's really uh it's kind of you know Scout's Honor on the user um but anyway one of the reasons we we just started with only making things from scratch from the jump was so that we could kind of sidestep those issues ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1747, Start: 1747, Overview: from scratch from the jump was so that we could kind of sidestep those issues for a little while but they're definitely super important and as you can tell with the number of people requesting the ability to upload images um you know it's a powerful thing and people can use it in ethical ways we ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1758, Start: 1758, Overview: um you know it's a powerful thing and people can use it in ethical ways we just want to try to help push people in that direction and uh will the full resolution have any limitations on sizing uh of output uh yes um there is a paper called gig again um I'm totally you know as I do just ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1773, Start: 1773, Overview: yes um there is a paper called gig again um I'm totally you know as I do just deviating from the demo uh and I'll pull this up um but this is some really cool oh shoot I haven't even blogged it yet gosh I I as much as I blog out there let me just ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1789, Start: 1789, Overview: haven't even blogged it yet gosh I I as much as I blog out there let me just pull it up uh Adobe gig again um but it's uh essentially up sampling technology and so being able to take uh small images and then being able to create these really you know beautiful ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1802, Start: 1802, Overview: small images and then being able to create these really you know beautiful high-res versions this is actually already being used as I understand it behind the scenes uh the way these diffusion models work the original image is quite tiny and then successively we upsample it to get you know like 1024 ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1814, Start: 1814, Overview: is quite tiny and then successively we upsample it to get you know like 1024 res but in principle you could go a lot beyond that and so one thing I think we will find helpful is if you can tell us you know not give me unlimited resolution which would be great of course we want to do ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1827, Start: 1827, Overview: not give me unlimited resolution which would be great of course we want to do that but like how important is that relative to other things we could be doing you know like is it more important to have a really high-res single photo or would it be able would it be more important to synthesize things as video ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1838, Start: 1838, Overview: or would it be able would it be more important to synthesize things as video you know not to say that's you know immediate offering or something but like being able to do um you know in painting uh you know filling a region and being able to do that on successive frames so there you ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1851, Start: 1851, Overview: filling a region and being able to do that on successive frames so there you know it's a different technical challenge you're trying to make sure that it's uh smooth as you go from frame to frame you know these are just the trade-offs we always have to make because of course ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1862, Start: 1862, Overview: you know these are just the trade-offs we always have to make because of course the answer is well you know we want it all we want it now um but yeah like how important is having higher resolution let's say for Print Work relative to other things um I think also what we'll find is that ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1873, Start: 1873, Overview: Work relative to other things um I think also what we'll find is that people are going to do a lot of sort of localized editing and so even if the output of the system isn't itself uh totally high if you could uh you know just act on a region within a photo um I think that would be really powerful ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1890, Start: 1890, Overview: just act on a region within a photo um I think that would be really powerful and and you know then the photo can be arbitrarily large you know if the region is isn't one one immense patch uh maybe the resolution we've got already is okay sufficient but really you tell us all right well listen we already flew ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 738, Start: 738, Overview: I've I've shown in past weeks is being able to like move around just very simple 3D objects think of it as like dollhouse furniture right and then using those to guide synthesis so that's another way of giving an example in that case it's using depth as the cue for how the diffusion process ought to work I ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 750, Start: 750, Overview: case it's using depth as the cue for how the diffusion process ought to work I was thinking this morning like I think a lot of the next leap in generative AI will be all all about specificity right it's not like well replace a jacket with another Jack like some you know leather jacket it's like replace it with this ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 764, Start: 764, Overview: another Jack like some you know leather jacket it's like replace it with this specific leather jacket or replace it 20 times with these specific 20 leather jackets right in place that's where it gets really powerful and it's less of a sort of crap shoot and it's more hey I intentionally as a maker have a vision ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 777, Start: 777, Overview: sort of crap shoot and it's more hey I intentionally as a maker have a vision in my mind help me get there faster and so the tech will will kind of help you with that all right give me one more second I can't get myself in painting access ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 790, Start: 790, Overview: give me one more second I can't get myself in painting access so I think I will be able to actually demo today because I didn't set myself up what about the corpse site I'm not signed in that's classic Adobe wasn't signed in give me one sec ah there we go ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 803, Start: 803, Overview: signed in that's classic Adobe wasn't signed in give me one sec ah there we go all right yeah at least it's it's better than the days when I worked on Photoshop and and every day you'd have to be downloading like a new build and like installing it and it could take this a long time at least now ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 816, Start: 816, Overview: new build and like installing it and it could take this a long time at least now all we have is like multiple websites to keep track of which is its own challenge all right so let's go to downloads I oh I'm gonna have to convert these give me one let me stop sharing so you don't have to ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 868, Start: 868, Overview: so yeah I shared I shared a link in the chat and this is the control net stuff and um hopefully it's not too too remedial uh if you've seen it before but um let me show you my my favorite example ah it's a couple things so this is just a little experiment I did and by the way ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 916, Start: 916, Overview: I'll just go with the turtle but instead of a brightly colored Turtle let's say brushed metal just so I can make it quick uh you know and much like you'd expect with these kind of nerdy demos there's all kinds of like controls and you can uh you can set like negative prompts yada ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 927, Start: 927, Overview: kinds of like controls and you can uh you can set like negative prompts yada yada but just for the sake of of showing how the tech works so uh that's pretty cool right literally from from like a napkin sketch to to this uh pretty photo realistic thing ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 1004, Start: 1004, Overview: little bit heavy-handed right but I was making the case to my teammates that Firefly needs this um good news they're working on it it's just there's a lot of anyway there's a lot of math involved um but these are all just you know very simple examples I made by messing with ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1015, Start: 1015, Overview: um but these are all just you know very simple examples I made by messing with the nap um on my iPhone you know doing some type setting and then feeding the results into uh into the eye candy site um but like you know via the other link I supplied you can go in and upload whatever you like so you can take these ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1029, Start: 1029, Overview: I supplied you can go in and upload whatever you like so you can take these you could do it there there's really like I say control net isn't uh one particular technology and it isn't from any one company it's just a set of capabilities kind of like image to image or depth to image that um helps give ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1041, Start: 1041, Overview: capabilities kind of like image to image or depth to image that um helps give more control as you're you're building stuff up uh let me show you the other example um if I can find it I always bring this one up as well super fun so uh somebody just ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 1082, Start: 1082, Overview: um giving it some parameters and you get this but again when I talk about specificity it's like this is um this is what we have in mind right like it's not it doesn't take away the Serendipity and the sense of play like you can still get a bunch of like unpredicted and or like variated results ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 114, Start: 114, Overview: and then my wife was with Adobe for many years and when our kids were little they would be frustrated because one of us would always be on a call with the the team in Germany who were of course many hours ahead of California time and I'm actually looking at our our pictures of our kids when when they were ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 126, Start: 126, Overview: and I'm actually looking at our our pictures of our kids when when they were about three and two and they're wearing a little saint Paulie you know football club uh shirts anyway I remember the three-year-old being kind of mad that Mom and Dad weren't around to make making breakfast and uh he said dado is ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 138, Start: 138, Overview: Mom and Dad weren't around to make making breakfast and uh he said dado is Mama talking to Germans I said yeah and he said no 999. so uh now my my level of German probably matches his but the other kid now has has like a thousand day streak on Duolingo teaching himself a language so maybe he can come and uh ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 154, Start: 154, Overview: day streak on Duolingo teaching himself a language so maybe he can come and uh he can be my presenter next week or for some future event I love that that's amazing yes and we do have some actually some German speaking people in the chat Henrik I know has done some streams apparently ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 169, Start: 169, Overview: Henrik I know has done some streams apparently so it's all very cool so all right well what are we doing what are we talking about this week what do you have what do you want to do what are we talking about okay well I have I have a couple things to show folks and then ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 183, Start: 183, Overview: we talking about okay well I have I have a couple things to show folks and then of course always really great to make this interactive and hear what is on your mind what you're excited about and so forth so let me let me start with a much much requested feature that ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 196, Start: 196, Overview: let me start with a much much requested feature that um we've talked about a couple times and what I'm about to show you is actually I have to put on a lot of caveats because it's it's uh experimental it's a work in progress It's not yet approved by Design leadership so like by the time ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 210, Start: 210, Overview: work in progress It's not yet approved by Design leadership so like by the time you see it next it'll probably have changed uh actually both things that I show you but just to give you sort of a more of a Glassdoor kind of look at what we're doing and trying to be responsive to the things ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 222, Start: 222, Overview: we're doing and trying to be responsive to the things um you know we hear from the community let me share my screen and um always always exciting to see if I get this right okay screens all right ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 234, Start: 234, Overview: always always exciting to see if I get this right okay screens all right cool let's give that a shot all right cool I think you guys are seeing my screen please holler if you're not yes okay we are yeah amazing okay so if you go to the um Adobe support Community which I always encourage people to do ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 250, Start: 250, Overview: go to the um Adobe support Community which I always encourage people to do um because Discord for all its charms doesn't make it super easy for us to persist things or to track stuff like votes for features I know this is probably a little small but trying to make it a bit bigger and that is where ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 265, Start: 265, Overview: probably a little small but trying to make it a bit bigger and that is where you can suggest feature improvements or new features and then you can vote on ones that other people have uh already suggested so as you can see the number one thing always is some some notion of personal archive so this could mean a ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 277, Start: 277, Overview: one thing always is some some notion of personal archive so this could mean a few different things it could mean um you know just let me say favorites it could mean uh capture history States so that as you're working you know maybe you come back next week and you're like oh what was that like I think steampunk ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 292, Start: 292, Overview: you come back next week and you're like oh what was that like I think steampunk golden doodle or I totally forgot I made that like let me take that in any direction so so this would basically be the same thing it's just um what I would call a favorite is something that you intentionally like ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 302, Start: 302, Overview: um what I would call a favorite is something that you intentionally like put a pin in and a history state of course is just one of n you know if it could be 20 it could be 50 but you know you just capture these and they kind of age out but they're essentially the same thing which is just a point in time ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 312, Start: 312, Overview: age out but they're essentially the same thing which is just a point in time and so uh when people talk about a personal archive I think that's largely what they have in mind of course the question is well once you have such an archive what do you want to do with it and the first thing of course is well ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 324, Start: 324, Overview: archive what do you want to do with it and the first thing of course is well let me just use it myself and then beyond that of course you could get into all kinds of cool things with sharing and community and remixing and like social feeds and like the Mind goes nuts and hap just materialized so hey yeah ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 333, Start: 333, Overview: social feeds and like the Mind goes nuts and hap just materialized so hey yeah cool um pep it up pass the mic to you in a bit but um yeah I just was telling folks that we're we're working on this number one feature request and so let me let me show you this extremely work in progress ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 346, Start: 346, Overview: one feature request and so let me let me show you this extremely work in progress implementation and if you have any thoughts please holler so you'll notice up here at the top there's this new tab called favorites uh this wouldn't show up if you were logged out or you didn't yet have access ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 359, Start: 359, Overview: uh this wouldn't show up if you were logged out or you didn't yet have access it really only makes sense you know when you actually have generated things that you want to hang on to and so in a module like text image you could go in son loves owls once all the beanies one loves animals someone both Atlas okay ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 371, Start: 371, Overview: son loves owls once all the beanies one loves animals someone both Atlas okay but be me on the owl maybe that would be my thing actually let's try that uh uh how about uh that's way too expensive yeah it's like that can't be done it's impossible it can't be done oh no we're gonna we're ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 386, Start: 386, Overview: that can't be done it's impossible it can't be done oh no we're gonna we're gonna glitch The Matrix if we uh we try anything too controversial uh and maybe because I misspelled it uh it doesn't seem to be wanting to wear a beanie uh maybe I decide well you know what ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 399, Start: 399, Overview: beanie uh maybe I decide well you know what you can't trust the wisdom of the machine don't uh Don't force the issue but let's just say I get to a place of something cool right and so uh after it thinks about it you'll notice up here uh I think you can ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 409, Start: 409, Overview: and so uh after it thinks about it you'll notice up here uh I think you can see it little heart icon favorite yeah kind of does what you'd hope it would do which is uh marks it has a favorite right and then it's marked as such and you could go to another one you could say well that's actually pretty good too ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 424, Start: 424, Overview: you could go to another one you could say well that's actually pretty good too uh and then maybe you know I apply some photographic style and see if that's good really any combination of variations should be captured and so just with the simple affordance you can Mark stuff as ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 435, Start: 435, Overview: should be captured and so just with the simple affordance you can Mark stuff as favorites now it's a little glitchy as you can tell like frankly what what probably should happen is these aren't marked as favorites because you know I've now changed the parameter so we'll we'll work on that that's why it's not ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 448, Start: 448, Overview: I've now changed the parameter so we'll we'll work on that that's why it's not shipping yet but just wanted to give you a taste of what we're thinking about so having marked them as favorites if I go now back to the site and of course there's no direct link yet between the two things but let's go back and we'll ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 458, Start: 458, Overview: there's no direct link yet between the two things but let's go back and we'll go into favorites and oh sorry I shouldn't nice it's a low keeper vanity who cares it's Friday um I was just trying to say what happens if I type A you know super long ass ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 469, Start: 469, Overview: um I was just trying to say what happens if I type A you know super long ass piece of text you know does it still look good and it looks yeah it looks kind of reasonable so uh wanted to show that I've just been going in and making uh various things and you know these two that I just made on the Fly did indeed ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 480, Start: 480, Overview: uh various things and you know these two that I just made on the Fly did indeed get saved um if you were here or you would be able to unfavor it if you were in uh the module you could go back and you could remove them in that way so again it's really really dirt simple now one one ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 491, Start: 491, Overview: remove them in that way so again it's really really dirt simple now one one thing where it'd be valuable to get your feedback feel free to chime in the chat um things get complicated when you get cloud storage involved and uh of course ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 500, Start: 500, Overview: things get complicated when you get cloud storage involved and uh of course what you'd expect to work is that yeah if you save these on one computer you log in a different one everything is there and of course then there's all the saving or the sharing stuff uh it just gets a little bit more technically ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 511, Start: 511, Overview: saving or the sharing stuff uh it just gets a little bit more technically involved when you'd have to deal with like quotas and all kinds of good stuff have to tell you more about than I could um we'll we'll work through all of that stuff The Proposal though or the thought is in the short term like literally ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 523, Start: 523, Overview: stuff The Proposal though or the thought is in the short term like literally hopefully you know a couple weeks um if we just sort store these in your browser on your computer uh then anytime you log in you would still have those uh items saved but on your computer so I don't know if there's a way uh to ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 536, Start: 536, Overview: items saved but on your computer so I don't know if there's a way uh to have a poll but basically the two choices are either we can roll that out hopefully very quickly um and you know if that's useful we could do it or B we could wait and say delay it by some number of weeks let's ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 689, Start: 689, Overview: until yesterday so um what's what's really cool and fun but also a little chaotic is there are so many teams across Adobe trying interesting stuff that um sometimes they pop out of the woodwork and you're like oh did you know about this guy in Bucharest who was just like ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 701, Start: 701, Overview: and you're like oh did you know about this guy in Bucharest who was just like playing around with the API and it's like I didn't but I'm glad he is and like tell me more so um the folks who were have worked on um the text effects capabilities have also been exploring like well what else ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 714, Start: 714, Overview: um the text effects capabilities have also been exploring like well what else could you do with that and so uh they call it asset generation I would actually just call it like uh you know Vector effects uh because really it's the same thing it's just instead of the shape of a character it's the shape of a ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 727, Start: 727, Overview: the same thing it's just instead of the shape of a character it's the shape of a shape right it should be an arbitrary shape and so um let me play this I don't think there's any sound and so the notion would be you'd go ahead and click on this module on the right uh much like ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 736, Start: 736, Overview: would be you'd go ahead and click on this module on the right uh much like recolor vectors you would get a bunch of presets you could play with uh potentially you could do things like search Adobe stock for free content which would obviously you know blow open tons of possibilities uh and much like ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 746, Start: 746, Overview: which would obviously you know blow open tons of possibilities uh and much like recolor vectors you could just you know drag your own thing in there but again the idea is really start with a very very simple primitive and then apply some styling to it so let me let that run and you know again just like ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 757, Start: 757, Overview: apply some styling to it so let me let that run and you know again just like you've seen with text effects or with vectors there'd be a bunch of styles uh you could click on those and then you're getting these various treatments so these are all bitmap although in principle ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 770, Start: 770, Overview: these are all bitmap although in principle um there could be a world where you know a vectorization technology gets really good um you could do things you know stylistically where it's appropriate where you could turn you know the vector ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 778, Start: 778, Overview: stylistically where it's appropriate where you could turn you know the vector into the bitmap into the vector and that would all be behind the scenes so you don't have to like see an intermediary uh you know jpeg or whatever but again substantially the idea here is like take a really simple input to ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 788, Start: 788, Overview: but again substantially the idea here is like take a really simple input to condition the generation and then make potentially interesting things from there obviously here the UI is not built out none of this is like guaranteed planned it's really just kind of like a first like Thumb in the wind like tell ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 800, Start: 800, Overview: planned it's really just kind of like a first like Thumb in the wind like tell us if you guys like this uh what would it need to be in order to be useful to you uh let me just let that play a bit more and here's sort of like beautiful watercolor or here's more of an oil ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 811, Start: 811, Overview: and here's sort of like beautiful watercolor or here's more of an oil painting um here's you know more of a sketch and then uh one of the the common requests of course we get is you know these are these are cool you could use them on their own but they're ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 822, Start: 822, Overview: you know these are these are cool you could use them on their own but they're really powerful if they have uh transparency you know so that it's actually like an isolated object so you could imagine in some hypothetical world again this is contingent on if you think this is actually worth doing ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 832, Start: 832, Overview: again this is contingent on if you think this is actually worth doing um you could have things in libraries and you know maybe drag that onto your artboard and then you could like invoke these effects and presumably what you'd want most of the time is not just now a rectangular image you know that's opaque ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 843, Start: 843, Overview: want most of the time is not just now a rectangular image you know that's opaque but you'd actually probably want the object with you know the nice path preserved much like you get with with text when you you know you have like a looseness setting so like how far out outside the bounds do we let the pixels ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 856, Start: 856, Overview: looseness setting so like how far out outside the bounds do we let the pixels go but once you've set that then you can save it you can copy it to clipboard with transparency and so forth so again this is just a very hopefully logical incremental way to leverage what we were ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 883, Start: 883, Overview: yeah that's that's why I really enjoy and value these uh conversations just because uh they give us such uh I mean it's not the most scientific thing for sure but it gives us a really good like first Thumb in the wind signal and uh you know there's always the problem in big companies of like they call it hippo ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 898, Start: 898, Overview: you know there's always the problem in big companies of like they call it hippo which is highest paid person's opinion and not to say Adobe has that but you know it's common to like just humans how we all roll and it's like well if we're just going to use opinions we're going to use like the most senior person's ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 968, Start: 968, Overview: um I think what because I am you know my my very arts and letters understanding of the mathematical processes that go on it is still producing uh imagery you know pixel imagery um which is then specially conditioned you know it's trained uh Vector data sets so it has like a certain appearance ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 993, Start: 993, Overview: know bitmap into Vector is something that's been around for many decades it's never generally as as excellent as one might like um so that's obviously an area of a very keen interest and and investment um but the net net is kind of what you're saying which is let me be able to ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1005, Start: 1005, Overview: um but the net net is kind of what you're saying which is let me be able to just type in some prompt let me get out check Vector sorry Vector art um or let me just take any arbitrary image regardless of whether it came from a prompt and get a really good looking ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 1030, Start: 1030, Overview: which I'm happy to stop doing uh I wanted to mention that um in painting uh comes along it's it's continuing to come along um we obviously want to make sure that the quality is super high and it's always an interesting judgment call around when do we start putting things ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1044, Start: 1044, Overview: always an interesting judgment call around when do we start putting things in people's hands obviously you don't want to do it if it's like uh you know hit or miss or if it's uh you know God forbid produces something offensive that's something we take super seriously in fact there's an Ethics review today ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 435, Start: 435, Overview: more what's in their mind side there's still a large degree of serendipity that's possible and as you'll see here in this demo often you can use really simple selections or simple cues but just having those is incredibly powerful so there's many ways to skin this cat one of them is this sketch to image ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 449, Start: 449, Overview: so there's many ways to skin this cat one of them is this sketch to image thing which was another piece of the puzzle and as you can imagine the pieces hopefully come together to make a pretty cool puzzle so specifically around 3D we're experimenting with using depth and as you might imagine depth can be ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 460, Start: 460, Overview: we're experimenting with using depth and as you might imagine depth can be achieved in a bunch of ways you can take a portrait mode photo you could interpret the depth just estimate it by looking at a 2d RGB image or in the case of having actual 3D geometry then you know intrinsically what the depth is ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 475, Start: 475, Overview: of having actual 3D geometry then you know intrinsically what the depth is because there's a model of the world and so hopefully it's big enough in your screen if not I'll just kind of narrate it and this is a video since I figured it'd be more reliable than doing a live live stream but um imagine you could ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 486, Start: 486, Overview: it'd be more reliable than doing a live live stream but um imagine you could start with a blank canvas or you could start potentially with a photograph and then you could drop things onto it which I think is really an interesting uh way to go so here we're just starting blank and I'll I'll pause this and scrub back ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 499, Start: 499, Overview: to go so here we're just starting blank and I'll I'll pause this and scrub back and forth that's cool I'm not sure if we can see that video I was looking at the website really I think you've shared just the browser window oh I'm right I'm sorry uh that's all right I always I always um ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 511, Start: 511, Overview: sorry uh that's all right I always I always um think these things are cognitive tasks to know if I am in fact smart enough to work here which certainly not I have to protect you a human ah share entire screen oh yes write it it's everything's in the ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 523, Start: 523, Overview: human ah share entire screen oh yes write it it's everything's in the library capture in the simulation okay doing better now I hope all right so now you're seeing yes brilliant all right thank you thank you for letting me know uh it would have been lame if you love me kept going okay so very simple GUI ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 536, Start: 536, Overview: uh it would have been lame if you love me kept going okay so very simple GUI this is before the design team has gotten their hands on this so many times folks doing the research have to of course figure out if this is even going to work is it worth a damn then we bring in designers who kind of get into this ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 548, Start: 548, Overview: to work is it worth a damn then we bring in designers who kind of get into this cool ping pong going back and forth shaping The Experience so right now uh just to set expectations very very Spartan and functional but it lets you do some neat stuff so what's happening is uh we're dragging in ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 560, Start: 560, Overview: but it lets you do some neat stuff so what's happening is uh we're dragging in this obj file super dirt simple effect uh Rock simple and then it says a big rock on the beach and just by typing that prompt boom you get a big rock on the beach and so just um going back a little bit ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 574, Start: 574, Overview: boom you get a big rock on the beach and so just um going back a little bit there's the incredibly like low poly very basic scene could not be a simpler scene really and that was something like a cube which you can also show and here it's just saying okay big rock on the beach if I let it play there's a little ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 589, Start: 589, Overview: it's just saying okay big rock on the beach if I let it play there's a little slider it's kind of playing with some interface ideas so you can actually see before and after another thought is well what if you wanted to build up more rocks right so using this little 3D Gizmo I think that is actually the term ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 598, Start: 598, Overview: rocks right so using this little 3D Gizmo I think that is actually the term of art it is you can clone these things  you know reshape them move them in space really super simple no complicated sculpting tools or whatever and just by doing that gets in this case where now you can say ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 612, Start: 612, Overview: doing that gets in this case where now you can say instead of a big rack on the beach I want to type uh Rocky Mountains uh beautiful landscape give it a second hit generate thanks for a couple seconds and bang right now again kind of interesting serendipitous uh didn't ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 624, Start: 624, Overview: and bang right now again kind of interesting serendipitous uh didn't specify water but that was one of the things that they came up with you can imagine an interface where you might get multiple versions kind of like today when you compose using text you want to make a photo you get a four up view ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 637, Start: 637, Overview: when you compose using text you want to make a photo you get a four up view potentially we could do something like that lots of decisions not yet made in fact that'll be one of the fun things to get your feedback on as we kind of proceed the nature of the Firefly site is meant to be this sort of incubator ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 648, Start: 648, Overview: proceed the nature of the Firefly site is meant to be this sort of incubator playground test environment where before we take on all the work of making something really polished and you know fit into Photoshop or substance designer or whatever it might be we get a chance to kind of be loose and ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 660, Start: 660, Overview: or whatever it might be we get a chance to kind of be loose and free and get your feedback so um let me continue playing this and again just kind of going back and forth so now you might want to say hey how about some more rocks and we might want to stretch those out so move these guys ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 674, Start: 674, Overview: about some more rocks and we might want to stretch those out so move these guys around and now build up like a whole mountain range stretch out some of those guys make them taller and ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 685, Start: 685, Overview: taller and I do like how it's the same model all the time it's just moving it around you don't have to have like 50 different Rock models just to create a line exactly exactly cool right and and so this is sufficient to go ahead and now ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 694, Start: 694, Overview: exactly exactly cool right and and so this is sufficient to go ahead and now compose a different take on Rocky Mountain's beautiful landscape right so now there's no foreground there's no water and it's already like damn that's I don't know it's my eye pretty cool uh obviously you could play around with ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 707, Start: 707, Overview: I don't know it's my eye pretty cool uh obviously you could play around with more props and you could give it different cues and you could keep keep pulling away but basically it's just sort of breaking this ground of saying what if you let folks use more semantic uh structures or or cues exactly how the ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 716, Start: 716, Overview: what if you let folks use more semantic uh structures or or cues exactly how the the process of generation should go so 3D is one option as I mentioned sketches other things can can do that and of course then they can start combining in pretty cool ways so let me play that again ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 732, Start: 732, Overview: combining in pretty cool ways so let me play that again let's say I think there's one more and this one they add a shape which is a cylinder kind of a big cylinder apparently and so let's say you wanted to put like a watchtower uh pep lives up in the mountains and I assume you have ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 747, Start: 747, Overview: to put like a watchtower uh pep lives up in the mountains and I assume you have like cool little watchtowers all around it's not San Jose which is where I live which is very flat and uh very vanilla so so this will be your next challenge have maybe compose some cool fire watch thing ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 761, Start: 761, Overview: have maybe compose some cool fire watch thing um so yeah just kind of placing this you can see it's trying to adhere to the rock pile again lots of of work to be done on that but the point is you can get to a sort of interesting place ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 770, Start: 770, Overview: done on that but the point is you can get to a sort of interesting place without really much of any 3D related experience and now say you've got Rocky Mountains beautiful landscape but we just want to add a watchtower uh in the middle of the Rocky Mountains beautiful landscape and go ahead and run that ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 783, Start: 783, Overview: middle of the Rocky Mountains beautiful landscape and go ahead and run that and bang now you got that result so yes super exciting let me um let me just see if there's other stuff in this one I think you guys get the point yeah yeah great and just you know a totally different treatment uh I'll tab over and ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 800, Start: 800, Overview: great and just you know a totally different treatment uh I'll tab over and show a different one which I think is really cool as well which is more of an indoor scene and so uh everything opens on the web monitor now uh obviously you can imagine we could provide a bunch of preset geometry ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 817, Start: 817, Overview: now uh obviously you can imagine we could provide a bunch of preset geometry but even if it's just this like caveman simple stuff like a cube as you're seeing here you can do stuff like stretch it out make a big rectangle fashion that into a wall duplicate it make a right angle ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 829, Start: 829, Overview: fashion that into a wall duplicate it make a right angle um shouldn't have to do that but but even even in the Spartan starting place you can do some school stuff so you can imagine there being a preset for something like a treaty or many different kinds of trees again let's say ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 841, Start: 841, Overview: something like a treaty or many different kinds of trees again let's say you don't even have that all you have are just these like you know 1980s I Want My MTV level uh graphical constructs right but you could make something sort of roughly approximating a Christmas tree ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 853, Start: 853, Overview: something sort of roughly approximating a Christmas tree and then guess what you could go in and type in you know a beautiful Christmas tree uh I think in a corner something like that don't even have to spell Christmas right well at least with capital and you hit go and thinks about ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 863, Start: 863, Overview: Christmas right well at least with capital and you hit go and thinks about it for a couple seconds and bang right now you've got this cool composition and then again an interesting time I realized uh I don't talking a lot it's usual let's just speed through and you know builds up scene uh props to ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 877, Start: 877, Overview: usual let's just speed through and you know builds up scene uh props to Matthias who's the engineer working on this who's also the demo artist so go ahead and put some you know boxes Around The Christmas Tree add um uh beautiful Christmas tree surrounding by presents in the corner of ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 889, Start: 889, Overview: um uh beautiful Christmas tree surrounding by presents in the corner of a room can't generate give it a couple seconds to think this is all real time and bang right now you've got this composition so just I think wild possibilities here especially you know you can imagine uh ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 899, Start: 899, Overview: so just I think wild possibilities here especially you know you can imagine uh you could have 2D sketches that's one technique you can use you can do 3D elements you could bring those together training your own model again like the Mount Rushmore example I think would be really interesting so hopefully it's ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 911, Start: 911, Overview: Mount Rushmore example I think would be really interesting so hopefully it's like you know the T1000 when he's all shattered and starts morphing back together um hopefully these little globules will uh we'll Voltron together just to completely mix franchises in in a cool ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 921, Start: 921, Overview: uh we'll Voltron together just to completely mix franchises in in a cool way um all right I will stop chattering and now pass to hap uh if you want to take us away and let's see if I I just want to say the chat is Thoroughly impressed and so am I I mean ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 936, Start: 936, Overview: I just want to say the chat is Thoroughly impressed and so am I I mean it's just the process thinking about all the steps that would be involved to get a scene like this from the just default Cube to the lighted and textured and bumpment ready scene this is just and yeah this is yeah oh I was gonna say ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 953, Start: 953, Overview: bumpment ready scene this is just and yeah this is yeah oh I was gonna say one of the one of the sort of cancellations of getting older is uh it's like in my day you know I I hit in college right I mean I remember using like strata 3D and um it was hooked on the school network ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 967, Start: 967, Overview: like strata 3D and um it was hooked on the school network so that uh you could license software and um I I had my machine in my girlfriend's room I you know it was like I get kicked out at midnight so I would like spend hours building up some scene I would hit ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 980, Start: 980, Overview: out at midnight so I would like spend hours building up some scene I would hit render I would leave I would come back the next morning as soon as you know guys were let back in and see and like there were four seconds of video composed and it was like it's just such a giant roll of the dice and so now to ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 990, Start: 990, Overview: composed and it was like it's just such a giant roll of the dice and so now to be able to do this in a web browser trivially with a couple of words is is beyond bananas and of course my kids will be like yeah what else you got right because of course that's just the world that they're starting in ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1002, Start: 1002, Overview: right because of course that's just the world that they're starting in um yeah you can control the composition like a big problem with photography right is you go to the shoot you do the shoot you come back and they're like this is great but we need to put text over here can you just like move ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1012, Start: 1012, Overview: this is great but we need to put text over here can you just like move everything over and you're looking at hours of compositing time right to like fulfill the brief so this is such a great tool for like oh you wanted the cover image to have text well let me just render something up for you and ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1023, Start: 1023, Overview: cover image to have text well let me just render something up for you and then you can use the rest of the shoot you know as we've done all right so I'm going to share my screen I'm going to share my entire screen and let me know ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 1145, Start: 1145, Overview: it's like it's very silly but it does work it's just you know we're adding some tens of thousands people every day it's just it's a whole thing um okay so if you if you can just go to the site um and click on the recolor module and you can upload your own SVG file but ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1156, Start: 1156, Overview: um and click on the recolor module and you can upload your own SVG file but just for convenience and speed let me click on one of the ones which is there yeah we can't see your screen again dude I'm sorry guys unless you want to do this what picture that's fine I guess no yeah ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 1186, Start: 1186, Overview: all right beautiful all right cool so recolor over on the right go ahead and click it uh if you want hit upload SVG again I'm just going to keep it simple by the way when you roll roll over these presets you then see the prompt uh it's probably tiny on your screen this one says retro futurism poster ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1198, Start: 1198, Overview: probably tiny on your screen this one says retro futurism poster um this one says blue purple and green and it gives you some different states of the art so you click it and in fact you will then see that prompt applied to the art and what's happening behind the scenes is just like in the text image ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1210, Start: 1210, Overview: the art and what's happening behind the scenes is just like in the text image module Firefly is generating images for each of these four variations and then those images are being used to transform the vector art right so it's extracting the color palette it's then mapping it on there and then you have some other ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1223, Start: 1223, Overview: the color palette it's then mapping it on there and then you have some other presets over on the right so if you want to do something like say well instead of you know blue purple and green let me try trippy disco lights you know because trippy disco cats seems appropriate to a Friday right and that's where ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1234, Start: 1234, Overview: trippy disco cats seems appropriate to a Friday right and that's where um maybe I'll pass the mic to have what what else should I show yeah so sometimes the colors can get a little far away they can get a little um you know Missy matchy kind of too garish so one of the things that we've ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1249, Start: 1249, Overview: um you know Missy matchy kind of too garish so one of the things that we've built into here is harmony rules so if you go to the drop down under Harmony and you choose analogous analogous is I as I said before I'm a color nerd so analogous is my favorite color rule because it's if you know color theory ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1263, Start: 1263, Overview: analogous is my favorite color rule because it's if you know color theory it's colors are all within um 90 degrees of each other so basically it's like a strip of colors that are pretty well matching because they're all close to each other on the color wheel so here you see that it took that trippy ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1275, Start: 1275, Overview: close to each other on the color wheel so here you see that it took that trippy disco lights and it kind of like brought it back is it still trippy disco lights yeah it's hooked trippy disco lights and it kind of like collapsed them down a little bit and kept the colors a little more cohesive so that they're not too ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1286, Start: 1286, Overview: little bit and kept the colors a little more cohesive so that they're not too like far apart on the color wheel there's nothing that's too bright it kind of like makes it so that it's a really harmonized design and if you choose for example like um the salmon sushi that one will tend to always give ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1297, Start: 1297, Overview: choose for example like um the salmon sushi that one will tend to always give you some salmon Shades because it's try trying to render like what the concept of salmon sushi is which is a lot of salmon sometimes it goes a little off off the you know to a different version of salmon sushi like this blue one but ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1309, Start: 1309, Overview: off the you know to a different version of salmon sushi like this blue one but you can see that um the color rules still kind of like collects it up together so the uh the greens in the top right one are all very similar the peach color for the um you know accent color those are both very similar and then the ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1325, Start: 1325, Overview: color for the um you know accent color those are both very similar and then the background color is really dialed in there and it makes it so that your artwork isn't it's kind of almost ready to go we have all the classic color rules built in there so if you chose Triad or one of the other color rules ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1337, Start: 1337, Overview: rules built in there so if you chose Triad or one of the other color rules now Triad takes your colors and instead of keeping them all together within 90 degrees on the color wheel it picks them at three separate points that are all equidistant apart so this is really common to make things pop you'll hear ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1348, Start: 1348, Overview: equidistant apart so this is really common to make things pop you'll hear that a lot um you know art directors are like ah that looks great you matched all those colors but actually I wanted it to pop so this is a way to kind of like take those colors and spread them out a ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1358, Start: 1358, Overview: so this is a way to kind of like take those colors and spread them out a little more and you can see like purple and green are usually pretty opposite each other like far apart from each other and then if you take complementary that will be exactly opposite each other on the color wheel so complementary ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1369, Start: 1369, Overview: that will be exactly opposite each other on the color wheel so complementary colors are the ultimate make it pop because they are the farthest apart which means that they are the most contrasty next to each other here my favorite combination is actually like blue and peach that's like one of the ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1380, Start: 1380, Overview: favorite combination is actually like blue and peach that's like one of the color combinations I go back to over and over again or like coral and baby blue like those coloring things so that top left one is like my favorite I would just print that right now I think it's absolutely lovely ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1391, Start: 1391, Overview: just print that right now I think it's absolutely lovely um so yeah like the color really help you out and then below that we have color locks so if you were like okay I need to have you know some set of colors but I also have to have blue because blue is our brand color which is really ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1404, Start: 1404, Overview: but I also have to have blue because blue is our brand color which is really common blue is a very um common brand color because it says authenticity and trustworthiness and things like that so what that'll do is that'll take that prompt but then it'll ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1414, Start: 1414, Overview: things like that so what that'll do is that'll take that prompt but then it'll bring in a lot of blue so that you're sure that that blue is going to be represented in the color um palette that it extracts from and then applies to the image and this is just a way to give you a little more ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1424, Start: 1424, Overview: then applies to the image and this is just a way to give you a little more control over the colors but often like especially for me um when I do like vector illustrations you'll hear oh I love this but I would love to see it in other color variations because we might want to use this in different contexts ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1436, Start: 1436, Overview: other color variations because we might want to use this in different contexts so this is a great tool to like quickly give you those variations the downloadable files are into SVG so it's still Vector um and we would love to know like how you think about this and how you might ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1448, Start: 1448, Overview: um and we would love to know like how you think about this and how you might use it in your workflow but some of the use cases that I definitely have are vector illustrations logo Renditions um especially like type I have a lot of type files that are all Vector like uh you know drawn type and those ones ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1461, Start: 1461, Overview: type files that are all Vector like uh you know drawn type and those ones you'll so often get like oh we loved that but we'd like it in different colors and they're really Plex there is one of the files that I shared with you is um named kardaval and that one is a pretty complex logo that um yeah that uh ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1472, Start: 1472, Overview: is um named kardaval and that one is a pretty complex logo that um yeah that uh you'll see like it's a really drawn logo not a font logo if that makes sense so this is a way that you can just like remap all of those colors really easily without having to do it by hand this would be so tedious to do by hand which ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1489, Start: 1489, Overview: without having to do it by hand this would be so tedious to do by hand which I've done before but you know the the goal is to not have to do it by hand right and also um well I've seen there are some color harmonies you've mentioned and if you need perhaps some help ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1505, Start: 1505, Overview: some color harmonies you've mentioned and if you need perhaps some help understanding what they really are I would recommend going to the color.ado.com website because on there you have essentially of course just a link in the Discord they have almost the same ones but you will actually see on ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1517, Start: 1517, Overview: link in the Discord they have almost the same ones but you will actually see on the color wheel um what they actually represents or split complementary for example those are analogous so we can see they're all right next to each other like you said um so yeah ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1530, Start: 1530, Overview: right next to each other like you said um so yeah I love the shout out this is my actual Adobe baby um I run Adobe color so this is like my most thing that I love working on the most um the Adobe color tool we've built a lot ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1541, Start: 1541, Overview: thing that I love working on the most um the Adobe color tool we've built a lot of more color harmonies into it um so you go play around with there and learn how they work on the color wheel and then you'll really understand how to dial those colors in and like I said the color Harmony rules are specifically ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1551, Start: 1551, Overview: dial those colors in and like I said the color Harmony rules are specifically scientifically made so that colors really react against each other or match cohesively like that's what the rule is based on the weight of the color wheel is laid out and the position of the colors across from each other or next to ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1562, Start: 1562, Overview: is laid out and the position of the colors across from each other or next to each other they're guaranteed to fall into a certain kind of category where they react really well against each other yeah and thanks that that's super interesting I love learning these ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1573, Start: 1573, Overview: yeah and thanks that that's super interesting I love learning these details um just while you were you were talking in just in case people wanted to know I was playing around with some of these things like shuffling colors so you can see uh what are the prominent colors in the generated art and then you ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1584, Start: 1584, Overview: you can see uh what are the prominent colors in the generated art and then you can go ahead and Shuffle those if you want which is usually a pretty quick process uh and I'll obviously there's a lot of degrees of freedom it's sort of deceptively simple as a module but you know you could go in here and type you ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1596, Start: 1596, Overview: deceptively simple as a module but you know you could go in here and type you know beautiful sunset or something uh and again back behind the scenes we're going to get four Images generated of beautiful sunsets the colors are then extracted and mapped onto the artwork and um ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1609, Start: 1609, Overview: extracted and mapped onto the artwork and um it's applying the complementary rule because I chose it from the menu and it then appears as a chip you know just like you would get in the image composition module but again I could just pop that off there if I want and ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1619, Start: 1619, Overview: composition module but again I could just pop that off there if I want and let it go to the defaults and that's what it looks like and you know if you happen not to like something you hit refresh so you can always go you know Mouse over something you can hit the little download button you can ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1630, Start: 1630, Overview: know Mouse over something you can hit the little download button you can download that variation and just be saving those and kind of really do it as much as you like in the live stream we did yesterday uh Samantha Warren is the design director was showing how you might use this for a mood board and so ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1639, Start: 1639, Overview: design director was showing how you might use this for a mood board and so it's like oh that's kind of neat I want to like Snap these off drop them into my library boom now they're in illustrator and I can just drag them onto the artboard and see different treatments really simply so even if this isn't ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1649, Start: 1649, Overview: artboard and see different treatments really simply so even if this isn't directly in illustrator or photoshop right now you can already kind of use the tools together in some pretty low friction ways two more things more things to know why why you'll see that the white is ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1659, Start: 1659, Overview: two more things more things to know why why you'll see that the white is respected and also if we had files with black the black will also be respected in the future we'll give you the the option to turn that off and let you you know it'll render into those spaces as well but for now we've given you that ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1671, Start: 1671, Overview: know it'll render into those spaces as well but for now we've given you that control um to be able to keep those elements those specific colors since often when something is Black or White like you want the colors around it to change but you actually want the source that you've ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1681, Start: 1681, Overview: want the colors around it to change but you actually want the source that you've designated black or white to remain the same and then the other thing if you drag in the file that I believe is called Wharf um which is a little illustration I did one of the greatest things about this ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1692, Start: 1692, Overview: um which is a little illustration I did one of the greatest things about this tool is that it actually respects things like clipping masks and gradients so this is a scene that I drew of like a bunch of people fishing on this little Wharf um this is something my boyfriend does all the time so he's the one at the ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1705, Start: 1705, Overview: Wharf um this is something my boyfriend does all the time so he's the one at the end sitting on the pier and you'll see that the gradient the color gradient in the background is respected so as you go through and apply different like try a couple different more Generations like hit maybe the midnight blue one or I ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1717, Start: 1717, Overview: couple different more Generations like hit maybe the midnight blue one or I forget what it's called the Blue you'll see that like there's still a gradient in the background and it's rendering in cohesively with the scene so this is something I use all the time like my second favorite thing to color ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1729, Start: 1729, Overview: so this is something I use all the time like my second favorite thing to color is gradient and that's why we built the gradient pools in Adobe color and Adobe capture and a bunch of other places I use it so much because it's a way to like make things pop and make things really especially like skies and ocean ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1743, Start: 1743, Overview: like make things pop and make things really especially like skies and ocean feel really cohesive feel real right so the fact that this also Maps color onto gradients I love that it does that it's like so much more powerful in my opinion yeah that that's really cool thank you I actually hadn't um I tried it on a ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1755, Start: 1755, Overview: yeah that that's really cool thank you I actually hadn't um I tried it on a gradient and so that's cool um one of my uh dreams because I always like 30 seconds after the engineers give us something amazing I'm like okay I've metabolized that what else you got um but one of my dreams is that we can ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1767, Start: 1767, Overview: metabolized that what else you got um but one of my dreams is that we can automatically create Vector meshes in the future I don't know if this is possible but that would be amazing because then sort of in concert with potentially generating imagery you could buy extension and generate Vector meshes ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1779, Start: 1779, Overview: potentially generating imagery you could buy extension and generate Vector meshes and it's a brilliant tool but often you see the stuff people made is like oh here's something from you know 2002 because there's like one dude in his apartment who took the time to really get precise and so as with everything we ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1792, Start: 1792, Overview: apartment who took the time to really get precise and so as with everything we want to democratize the on-ramps to these various Technologies I think just by what you see here you can get a lot of cool color things that that might have otherwise been a little bit intimidating ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1805, Start: 1805, Overview: have otherwise been a little bit intimidating um but there's many things we'd love to do subsequently so we'll see how how we can go because with that where I guess we're already over time as always happens yeah that's one last question from mind so to ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1814, Start: 1814, Overview: already over time as always happens yeah that's one last question from mind so to clarify if you download the file there will be still a SVG so we can edit that in other words that's right it's got all those colors applied in SVG even um yeah people don't necessarily have them handy but you can always just ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1829, Start: 1829, Overview: um yeah people don't necessarily have them handy but you can always just export them from illustrator so you know it's um it's really just you know been around open standard 20 years and so you should just be able to save artwork if you want to bring them into this path yeah and if ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 163, Start: 163, Overview: there should be a right next to the camera button yeah nice you guys see that okay yes sir got it all right so it's going to walk you through a few of the different kind of directions that I've been playing with so first was just ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 177, Start: 177, Overview: directions that I've been playing with so first was just kind of 3D cute 3D characters this is kind of like the kind of things you would see in like a Pixar movie um so one of the things that was amazing to me was how consistent all of these are ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 189, Start: 189, Overview: so one of the things that was amazing to me was how consistent all of these are because you know in a lot of text to image things it's hard to get consistency as far as like backgrounds and stuff um so I just let me just walk through some of these ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 202, Start: 202, Overview: um so I just let me just walk through some of these and you can see even in Full Resolution they're pretty amazing so um the Google Doc that was shared has the actual The Prompt structure for these but it's actually pretty simple it's just a cute 3D character made of ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 216, Start: 216, Overview: these but it's actually pretty simple it's just a cute 3D character made of and then each one of these has a different material to make these characters out of um some of the prompts I had to get a little more detailed but I'll talk about that when I talk about kind of tips and ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 228, Start: 228, Overview: little more detailed but I'll talk about that when I talk about kind of tips and tricks um so this was a salad this is a bunch of mismatched socks which is pretty funny I believe this one was bubble wrap um car parts uh gummy candy and you know one of the ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 243, Start: 243, Overview: um car parts uh gummy candy and you know one of the things it's difficult to come up with inspiration when you're just sitting at your computer so one of the things I did I happen to be in Safeway and I just started looking like hey what are some ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 256, Start: 256, Overview: I happen to be in Safeway and I just started looking like hey what are some colorful interesting Foods you know that I could generate these characters out of so I've definitely found that like looking for inspiration off of the computer is actually a really good thing to come up with ideas ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 269, Start: 269, Overview: computer is actually a really good thing to come up with ideas um this was a little Concrete Man this is uh I believe copper and electrical circuits so I won't go through I don't know how much time we have I won't go through all ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 283, Start: 283, Overview: so I won't go through I don't know how much time we have I won't go through all of these but I think you're the star of the show and we got like half an hour so oh okay okay well I'll go through them so this guy uh was french fries and I added a red container french fry golden french fries in a red container to kind ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 297, Start: 297, Overview: added a red container french fry golden french fries in a red container to kind of generate this like McDonald's style character um let me see uh this one was uh yeah this one I got a little more wordy cute 3D character made of delicate ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 312, Start: 312, Overview: uh yeah this one I got a little more wordy cute 3D character made of delicate intricately arranged flower petals um I really like the food ones so this is a bite-sized sushi rolls and again the the quality of these kind of blew my mind and I'm not saying that because I work ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 329, Start: 329, Overview: quality of these kind of blew my mind and I'm not saying that because I work for Adobe um it it it just was so much fun to generate these and once you kind of have a prompt structure that's working for you then it's really just changing in this case the the material that the ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 342, Start: 342, Overview: you then it's really just changing in this case the the material that the characters was going to be made out of um and It produced some kind of amazing results like I love this little pastry guy uh fluffy marshmallows I mean it's just kind of incredible that it can come up ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 356, Start: 356, Overview: uh fluffy marshmallows I mean it's just kind of incredible that it can come up with this kind of stuff without a lot of kind of detailed prompts and you know one of the things I mentioned in the tips and tricks in the Google Doc was it's always good to start with a short prompt first because if you put this ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 371, Start: 371, Overview: it's always good to start with a short prompt first because if you put this long really detailed prompt um in there you might get your result but you really don't know like which parts of that huge prompt have actually gotten you to that result so a lot of these were just started with just ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 387, Start: 387, Overview: gotten you to that result so a lot of these were just started with just typically a simple short prompt and if that didn't work then I would slowly add stuff to The Prompt um so I would know you know the things I added to the prompt how it was affecting ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 398, Start: 398, Overview: so I would know you know the things I added to the prompt how it was affecting the image so that's one of the things I found like simple is oftentimes better when it comes to these um so here's just a quick question from somebody in the chat they were asking about how you make things really ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 412, Start: 412, Overview: somebody in the chat they were asking about how you make things really high-res like what tools do you prefer so this is not anything other than the the images that come out of firefly itself so these haven't been upscaled these are I believe these are 10 24 by 1024 which is the size that you get out ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 427, Start: 427, Overview: these are I believe these are 10 24 by 1024 which is the size that you get out of firefly so none of these have been manipulated in Photoshop these are literally directly out of firefly that's your thing leave for all of these did you start with like a cute 3D character made of nacho cheese or like is that the ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 442, Start: 442, Overview: you start with like a cute 3D character made of nacho cheese or like is that the start for each of these that you're showing yeah so they they all started with a cute 3D character made of and then uh so a couple of these and I'll actually talk about ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 456, Start: 456, Overview: a couple of these and I'll actually talk about um I actually use chat GPT to help me come up with some ideas which is another really powerful thing to do in general is you leverage kind of one AI tool to help you with another um so a lot of these I came up with out ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 469, Start: 469, Overview: help you with another um so a lot of these I came up with out of my head but then um then I just kind of had a block so I went to chat GPT and I can actually show how I did that there but it will just generate prompts prompt ideas for you all day long ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 482, Start: 482, Overview: generate prompts prompt ideas for you all day long um so like this one for instance it probably might have worked with nachos I believe this is the one one of the ones I got out of chat GPT and it kind of makes them more wordy um ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 496, Start: 496, Overview: makes them more wordy um but that's kind of the mystery of text to images you know you really don't know which part of the prompt uh is really doing its thing so you know you don't necessarily have to be all I probably didn't have to make it this wordy to get ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 510, Start: 510, Overview: necessarily have to be all I probably didn't have to make it this wordy to get the result I don't know if that answers the question yeah that's super helpful we actually have someone that put in uh I think somehow sees the prompt made of gooey melted cheese and crunchy nacho ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 521, Start: 521, Overview: I think somehow sees the prompt made of gooey melted cheese and crunchy nacho chips yeah this is a kebab guy which is pretty funny I didn't think I'd really be able to come up with anything from kebabs but it did uh cheesy uh tasty lasagna ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 532, Start: 532, Overview: to come up with anything from kebabs but it did uh cheesy uh tasty lasagna noodles and Rich tomato sauce um yeah so I'll just uh shimmering soap bubbles which is a really kind of really amazing effect it came up with this pizza guy is pretty ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 548, Start: 548, Overview: really kind of really amazing effect it came up with this pizza guy is pretty awesome I know uh Chris Georgina's uh did a nice animation with a pizza slice you guys which is really cool uh it's funny you mentioned Chris because I was I was just tweeting out hey we're doing this uh live on Twitter ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 562, Start: 562, Overview: because I was I was just tweeting out hey we're doing this uh live on Twitter and I was after I shared your document I was at mentioning Chris and being like hey like it would be great for you to share a similar doc um but yeah because you guys are discovering these really cool corners of ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 573, Start: 573, Overview: um but yeah because you guys are discovering these really cool corners of latent space and then uh if folks haven't checked it out uh we can maybe share links but um yes you're saying he then takes these into like Adobe animate and after effects and like bring someone to life ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 583, Start: 583, Overview: into like Adobe animate and after effects and like bring someone to life which is super magical yeah he's kind of the master at that even way back in the flash days that's what that's what he was doing so this is kind of opened up for I'm assuming a whole new world for him too so ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 610, Start: 610, Overview: know certain prompts you put in you have to know when to quit but you know I think I feel like a lot of people just put in a prompt they get the four Images maybe they hit refresh once and then they just abandon it so you definitely want to be patient um ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 623, Start: 623, Overview: want to be patient um but there is a kind of a cutting off point where I'm like you know I'm not going to spend this much time on you know so it's just not working so I move on from that so that's another thing it's it's a kind of a delicate balance ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 634, Start: 634, Overview: on from that so that's another thing it's it's a kind of a delicate balance of knowing when to give up on an idea um yeah so just uh this is a chocolate truffle this one's pretty funny multi-colored yarn and knitting needles nice I like that guy yeah it's just kind ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 648, Start: 648, Overview: multi-colored yarn and knitting needles nice I like that guy yeah it's just kind of you know I just sit there and it kind of blows my mind the stuff it comes up with yeah this is the kind of a weathered metal effect and this guy's crazy ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 663, Start: 663, Overview: effect and this guy's crazy yeah I like the point you made earlier about using your natural environment as sort of stimuli and I have among her many other talents and projects works on Adobe capture and so we've been kind of noodling no pun intended uh on like what ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 678, Start: 678, Overview: Adobe capture and so we've been kind of noodling no pun intended uh on like what could you do if you actually you know could sample from the world right I mean you can do it conceptually as a human and be like oh that I see noodles and I type in noodles but like I don't know there seem to be a lot of possibilities ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 690, Start: 690, Overview: type in noodles but like I don't know there seem to be a lot of possibilities once you can you know use reference images as well so not to promise anything always just one of the the things that I thought of when you were talking about sampling of the world yep that would be amazing you know and ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 702, Start: 702, Overview: talking about sampling of the world yep that would be amazing you know and even went into uh Michael's you know which is like the big art store uh just looking for like hey you know what are some real world kind of uh this is when I was doing more illustration things but you know just looking around because you ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 715, Start: 715, Overview: I was doing more illustration things but you know just looking around because you know sitting on your computer is not always the best for well it's generally not the best for coming up with uh with ideas but uh it's not sure share one um a different one here which is the ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 728, Start: 728, Overview: uh it's not sure share one um a different one here which is the plush toys I'll just show you the the grid of these so this is basically uh you know stuffed animals um and again The Prompt structure for this ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 743, Start: 743, Overview: um and again The Prompt structure for this uh was generally a cute 3D furry plush toy of a and then you basically put in the animal um but you know a lot of things they when you see them at lower resolution ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 793, Start: 793, Overview: showed up and I just want to let them know what we're doing so hey welcome we're hanging out with the Firefly team John and have both are on the Firefly team and Lee has also works at Adobe has been playing around in the tool and is showing us some of the prompts that he's been using to generate these fun ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 804, Start: 804, Overview: showing us some of the prompts that he's been using to generate these fun characters so we're kind of going through some examples and Lee I think it'll be fun at some point while we're on here today maybe we should actually jump in Firefly and maybe experiment with a new character with one of the ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 814, Start: 814, Overview: jump in Firefly and maybe experiment with a new character with one of the like kind of the prompt strings that you've shared with people to see what we can get absolutely so yep just uh hey yeah no that that would be great I mean that's one of the things you can ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 824, Start: 824, Overview: no that that would be great I mean that's one of the things you can actually do from the Google Doc that that keeps disappearing as people chat I don't know how to pin it but whatever it's okay um but yeah that actually uh put in some URLs for for the Creations themselves so ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 834, Start: 834, Overview: um but yeah that actually uh put in some URLs for for the Creations themselves so along with the images there's actually clickable links that'll get you into a similar starting place and then of course you can read from there so I mean needless to say but I'll say it because we're thinking a lot about it like we ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 847, Start: 847, Overview: needless to say but I'll say it because we're thinking a lot about it like we want to make that not hacky you shouldn't have to pass around Word documents um not quite there yet but in principle right I want it so that you know when when somebody shares something on ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 855, Start: 855, Overview: right I want it so that you know when when somebody shares something on Twitter whatever like you should be able to then kick off a process so in the meantime you can do it just uh just via that doc as an FYI yeah yeah so just to recap these are all base the basic prompt ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 865, Start: 865, Overview: as an FYI yeah yeah so just to recap these are all base the basic prompt structures cute 3D furry plush toy of whatever animal or or object uh that you want so these are bald eagle a bunny and again the you know it looks like a photograph it looks like a studio photo of a stuffed animal which was ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 900, Start: 900, Overview: um to get kind of a consistent look like they were all kind of shot in the same place is to specify a neutral background if that's what you're looking for a neutral gray background it's what I started to do with a lot of these prompts ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 915, Start: 915, Overview: started to do with a lot of these prompts um because if you don't do that you're gonna get different colored backgrounds some backgrounds are going to be busy um you know with with other elements and stuff so that really helped um to kind of get a consistent ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 925, Start: 925, Overview: stuff so that really helped um to kind of get a consistent look and feel I would also imagine that helps if you want to do compositing or animation or anything I just dropped a image from Chris in the chat where he's made dozens of these ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 940, Start: 940, Overview: I just dropped a image from Chris in the chat where he's made dozens of these little like Warrior bunnies and um composited them in Photoshop and so yeah that's a good a good tip Not only would it help you get consistency which I hadn't really thought about but also you know then you could use select ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 955, Start: 955, Overview: I hadn't really thought about but also you know then you could use select subject or other you know techniques to grab the thing knock out the background I mean of course in some future state it would be great if that could the options you know to generate transparency automatically ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 966, Start: 966, Overview: you know to generate transparency automatically um so not there yet but certainly one of the things that engineering folks are thinking about yeah and this you know these would be easily separated with the magic wand tool even it's pretty you know not for ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 976, Start: 976, Overview: easily separated with the magic wand tool even it's pretty you know not for anybody who uses that anymore I still use it oh dude you can always you can tell when people learn Photoshop by what tools they use it's kind of like you know the Rings in the tree and it's like oh is quick select new when you started ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 990, Start: 990, Overview: know the Rings in the tree and it's like oh is quick select new when you started and or oh you're more of a select subject person or and then I was teasing Davis our designer his dad just celebrated 38 years at Adobe and Davis was using the pen tool to like make clipping paths and I'm like oh my God ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1002, Start: 1002, Overview: was using the pen tool to like make clipping paths and I'm like oh my God like you must have learned that in utero and then uh like it's just it's now fused with you so even though that's like the most old-school pre-layers technique hey if it works it works yeah thank you ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 1087, Start: 1087, Overview: did with uh with Play-Doh so the basic prompt structure for these were bald eagle made of Play-Doh with a neutral gray background um so so here again is the content type I have it set to none right here um which generally Works um you can set it to photo if you want it's just if I ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1105, Start: 1105, Overview: um which generally Works um you can set it to photo if you want it's just if I had set it to graphic or art then it's not going to look like a photo basically it's going to look more like a illustration or painting um one of the things though is uh I guess it's a tip is um I don't use any ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1117, Start: 1117, Overview: um one of the things though is uh I guess it's a tip is um I don't use any of this UI at all um so these are basically um preset styles that uses the the style engine in Firefly so you have you know these um you know art style movements you know ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1134, Start: 1134, Overview: these um you know art style movements you know techniques effects materials um you can look through these and you know click on them and it will add it and to your prompt not as part of the prompt but it's kind of a style parameter ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1148, Start: 1148, Overview: prompt but it's kind of a style parameter um but I don't uh so I don't want people to be limited thinking these are the only things that it could handle because Firefly can handle pretty much anything you throw at it like as far as materials art styles techniques and the ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1160, Start: 1160, Overview: you throw at it like as far as materials art styles techniques and the other thing at least the the way it currently works is if I were to put one of these in so say marble if I were to click and put it in here it wouldn't pull hold as much weight as if I added marble to The Prompt itself so you ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1177, Start: 1177, Overview: pull hold as much weight as if I added marble to The Prompt itself so you prompt uh takes the highest priority so and then the other thing is just it's a lot easier I like the idea of just being able to share just a piece of text for the prompt instead of like here's the prompt and here's the Styles added ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1192, Start: 1192, Overview: for the prompt instead of like here's the prompt and here's the Styles added is that the way it it it's still working right John maybe um I I probably made this trip last week uh my friend who learned radio repair talked about FM technology where it's ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1207, Start: 1207, Overview: uh my friend who learned radio repair talked about FM technology where it's effing magic uh so so you could be right I think we're still kind of all navigating this light in space and yeah I did I did ask somebody uh you know yeah internally about that and they and they mentioned yeah yeah I I think I ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1222, Start: 1222, Overview: yeah internally about that and they and they mentioned yeah yeah I I think I think you're right I think really you know there's a bunch of stuff behind the scenes there's like um what they call Prompt engineering you know where um you might type something in and then ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1234, Start: 1234, Overview: know where um you might type something in and then based on certain you know heuristics it like expands uh that or maybe it adds negative props there's also some imagery being mixed in behind the scenes you know when you click the the things on the right ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1246, Start: 1246, Overview: know when you click the the things on the right um obviously you can't mix in your own image yet that'd be cool um but yeah it there's there's these interesting tensions then that kind of arise as you you give it direction to one ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1256, Start: 1256, Overview: arise as you you give it direction to one one way but then maybe pull back in another and so I honestly just encourage folks to um yeah screw around and find out you know and then uh of course you can you can share the these very long URLs ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1269, Start: 1269, Overview: know and then uh of course you can you can share the these very long URLs um as as we're doing here in the chat that's not the most sustainable thing of course as more parameters grow but in the meantime if somebody else has access and you want them to have your creation as a starting place that is one way to ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1280, Start: 1280, Overview: and you want them to have your creation as a starting place that is one way to do it yep yeah I mean generally because I I you know I was always looking for other things that maybe were not in this UI so I would I just started typing stuff in ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1292, Start: 1292, Overview: things that maybe were not in this UI so I would I just started typing stuff in directly as part of the prompt and I just kind of stuck with that that's not to say that that's the correct approach or not um so we can try to make uh let's see let's um let's have that let's see if ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1305, Start: 1305, Overview: um so we can try to make uh let's see let's um let's have that let's see if the folks watching want to like oh I see a dog I see a good dog let's see if the folks watching want to chime in maybe they can give us their opinion on um we could maybe say do you want us to do like a Play-Doh uh balsa wood carving ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1321, Start: 1321, Overview: could maybe say do you want us to do like a Play-Doh uh balsa wood carving like let's start with one of your basic ones and then play with it yeah so okay so it could be uh a cute 3D plush toy a cute 3D character balsa wood or Play-Doh which one sounds most fun ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1339, Start: 1339, Overview: or Play-Doh which one sounds most fun love balsa wood guy but yeah we also try rusty metal who knows we've got some balsa wood in here and Doc people want to see dogs so it sounds like we've already got our noun I can generate a plush toy ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1353, Start: 1353, Overview: already got our noun I can generate a plush toy dog some very good boys are entering the chat they are chocolate Dot yeah it looks like we want to do uh yeah dog some type of wood ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1372, Start: 1372, Overview: to do uh yeah dog some type of wood or we also have a watermelon dog in the chat yeah I'm sorry I thought it was giving a thumbs up I think it's like an extra stem because like somehow generative ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1390, Start: 1390, Overview: thumbs up I think it's like an extra stem because like somehow generative models aren't great at counting which is always sort of sometimes Charming oh yeah no I was just saying so generally the approach I took was so if I'm making a plush toy of a German Shepherd I typed that in first and then ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1403, Start: 1403, Overview: I'm making a plush toy of a German Shepherd I typed that in first and then um the this button up here which this show similar if I had one that was kind of in the direction I was looking like these don't really look super furry um so I would hit this ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1417, Start: 1417, Overview: don't really look super furry um so I would hit this kind of use that as as inspiration for the future ones um and then once these come in then you know you can kind of just keep following down this Rabbit Hole so you know let's ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1431, Start: 1431, Overview: know you can kind of just keep following down this Rabbit Hole so you know let's say this one's a little closer then I would click that one and you know I have no idea what's happening behind the scenes when I do this it just seemed to be uh it just kind of gives like a more consistent expression like I wanted the ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1443, Start: 1443, Overview: be uh it just kind of gives like a more consistent expression like I wanted the mouth open things like that um so I would just start with oh go ahead sorry just a quick question um maybe you're going to show this or I'm just curious if you ever use a sort ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1456, Start: 1456, Overview: um maybe you're going to show this or I'm just curious if you ever use a sort of an obscure feature but if you roll over uh in the little drop down or the little overflow menu for any of these guys there's you can start with an image and then you can kind of directly riff off that so if you yeah the second thing ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1467, Start: 1467, Overview: and then you can kind of directly riff off that so if you yeah the second thing is like use this reference image yeah yeah again nobody uh is finding it that's okay we'll make it more prominent but go ahead and click it if you wouldn't mind then we can just kind of plug this as a way to get feedback on ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1479, Start: 1479, Overview: wouldn't mind then we can just kind of plug this as a way to get feedback on those features so essentially what's happening if you haven't tried this yet so it's uh using that same prompt and everything to create something now what you can do is uh mutate like if you change the prompt right now you were to ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1493, Start: 1493, Overview: you can do is uh mutate like if you change the prompt right now you were to say instead of a German Shepherd uh I don't know a Chihuahua or something um what it'll do is it will generate new imagery but it will be anchored on the previous image and then the little slider you get when you click on the ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1508, Start: 1508, Overview: previous image and then the little slider you get when you click on the previous image changes the strength between the old one and the new one so if you were to click that little thumbnail to your left there and then crank it way more towards prompt and regenerate what you should see is now ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1520, Start: 1520, Overview: crank it way more towards prompt and regenerate what you should see is now more Chihuahuas coming into the images oh yeah yeah but yeah okay yeah or beagle sure so um and so I demonstrated one where it was like in the inspiration feed it was like ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1535, Start: 1535, Overview: and so I demonstrated one where it was like in the inspiration feed it was like a little magical Cottage in the forest and I changed Forest to Beach right and then as as I change it more towards the prompt the new prompt uh it's then becoming more Beach and less forest and so it's ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1547, Start: 1547, Overview: becoming more Beach and less forest and so it's it's kind of a cool emerging way to dial things in still very experimental as you can tell but because this would have helped a lot yeah I didn't even yeah I I heard somebody mention it on Twitter but yeah I didn't ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1560, Start: 1560, Overview: didn't even yeah I I heard somebody mention it on Twitter but yeah I didn't actually play with it so yeah we'll make it make it more discoverable for sure but for now like the show assembler I find that that's kind of fun because um it's even quicker and you can sort of ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1575, Start: 1575, Overview: that's kind of fun because um it's even quicker and you can sort of like rabbit hole down really fast into a specific concept oh so we can try to create a character if somebody has a good idea for a material to make the character out of so we want material suggestions ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 262, Start: 262, Overview: figure out how to share my screen um and first question John somebody's curious for Firefly yeah it's a really good question um I was chatting this morning with some Enterprise customers and they were ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 276, Start: 276, Overview: um I was chatting this morning with some Enterprise customers and they were asking just the same thing so I think there's a a chain of things we have to do before getting there um you know as you've probably heard we say on the Firefly site that this output isn't for commercial use and you know ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 290, Start: 290, Overview: say on the Firefly site that this output isn't for commercial use and you know get the little Watermark accordingly and really that's because we're working through these really foundational questions about you know how do we acknowledge and compensate creators you know folks who've contributed their work ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 303, Start: 303, Overview: acknowledge and compensate creators you know folks who've contributed their work to Adobe stock um so I think we need to get through some of those questions and then we can think about okay now that the model's in a good State it's safe and commercially viable ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 315, Start: 315, Overview: a good State it's safe and commercially viable um how do we actually integrate it into different surfaces you know as you'd expect we're of course putting it into tools like Photoshop and express um but I'd love to see a world where you know from ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 326, Start: 326, Overview: um but I'd love to see a world where you know from whatever surface makes sense um you could you can invoke these tools uh I would say yeah please please uh share details um here or you know feature requests really getting specific about exactly ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 339, Start: 339, Overview: um here or you know feature requests really getting specific about exactly what you want to do helps us make the case that that's something we should pray uh prioritize um okay so uh our focusing on my screen yes sir okay cool and uh hopefully it's not too ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 350, Start: 350, Overview: yes sir okay cool and uh hopefully it's not too small I'm making it trying to make the content a little bit bigger just because uh I know it gets a little shrunk down um but what I thought I'd do is just kind of give you an update on the recolor vector work that's something I ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 363, Start: 363, Overview: kind of give you an update on the recolor vector work that's something I showed last week obviously not everybody here today was there um but it's come along a lot and the team is really getting into a good state so we'd love to get into your hands as soon as we can but in the meantime I can ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 372, Start: 372, Overview: so we'd love to get into your hands as soon as we can but in the meantime I can kind of show you uh where we are so um if I choose recolor vector and and by the way if you're familiar with uh the retailer feature in illustrator this is related it uses some of the same Tech to take ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 385, Start: 385, Overview: illustrator this is related it uses some of the same Tech to take um sort of the distribution of of color and tone in an image and then map that into uh Vector R uh the difference here is the image is being generated by Firefly so you can really just think of whatever you'd like type it in as a ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 399, Start: 399, Overview: Firefly so you can really just think of whatever you'd like type it in as a prompt and it'll make it and to give you kind of a running start we actually Supply a bunch of um images in SVG form with some prompts and so uh let's try this uh cat I'm gonna say I think it's a cat uh let's ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 411, Start: 411, Overview: and so uh let's try this uh cat I'm gonna say I think it's a cat uh let's try the prompt and you know much like when you hit the inspiration stream for images when I click this it loads the SVG and it applies uh purple blue and green that's not the most exciting what if we said uh a vibrant sunset ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 426, Start: 426, Overview: green that's not the most exciting what if we said uh a vibrant sunset and so you're not changing any of the geometry obviously of the cat you're just typing in a new prompt behind the scenes it's generating images of sunsets and then once those exist it will apply those tones uh to this artwork ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 440, Start: 440, Overview: and then once those exist it will apply those tones uh to this artwork and so I can Mouse over these so I have a little like uh Pinterest extension so it kind of tries to override in case you see a little save button but really you could just Mouse over these guys and then one of the cool things is uh unless ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 453, Start: 453, Overview: could just Mouse over these guys and then one of the cool things is uh unless it has disappeared which is why we're not shipping quite yet um you have these affordances for seeing the colors and then actually reshuffling them so this little uh bunch of color Pips in the upper left are the images in ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 465, Start: 465, Overview: them so this little uh bunch of color Pips in the upper left are the images in or sorry the colors in the image and then if I hit this little Shuffle button it's then going to shuffle those in in the artwork and if I get to a state I like of course I can hit the down button and it's going to download an SVG and ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 480, Start: 480, Overview: like of course I can hit the down button and it's going to download an SVG and just to show it really is happening oh that was small okay uh we gotta figure figure out there's still a few little bugs obviously that's again why we're not shipping it you got the idea right but it but it is in fact factor and it ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 495, Start: 495, Overview: not shipping it you got the idea right but it but it is in fact factor and it smells uh it scales up smoothly I'll have to file a bug after the session um but yeah really really pretty straightforward the other thing we've done is added presets over on the right so kind of like the settings you can use ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 506, Start: 506, Overview: done is added presets over on the right so kind of like the settings you can use when you're generating an image or styling text you can go in and be like uh yeah what if it was the cat at a Trippy Disco I've never seen that so take a look and it's generating trippy disco images and ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 518, Start: 518, Overview: I've never seen that so take a look and it's generating trippy disco images and then making these colors and you can actually shuffle them here in the four up view as well if you want to try a few different treatments um So within each one you get these uh n different colors and then reshuffling ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 529, Start: 529, Overview: um So within each one you get these uh n different colors and then reshuffling just changes which objects are are having which colors apply to them so uh yeah again it's pretty straightforward uh cool oh and then the last thing I'm somehow forgetting let me just drag my ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 541, Start: 541, Overview: uh cool oh and then the last thing I'm somehow forgetting let me just drag my own svgen but yeah go ahead yes no I I'm just this still blows my mind I know we've been like working you've been working in depth on it for a while and I've been aware of a lot of these things for a minute but I don't know maybe it ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 552, Start: 552, Overview: I've been aware of a lot of these things for a minute but I don't know maybe it says my age but every time I see these new tools even when they're in work in progress I can't even believe that it's a possibility so it's yeah it's really fun to see this set we'll come to life yeah that's that's a good reminder I ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 565, Start: 565, Overview: fun to see this set we'll come to life yeah that's that's a good reminder I think um I think the the way the rate at which we metabolize magic has gone Sky High right and so it's like oh that's like so 10 a.m you know it's like 3 P.M on board already like that's which you know price that into the world ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 580, Start: 580, Overview: on board already like that's which you know price that into the world um but it is good to remember to step back and be like Oh yeah this is this is FM technology uh the m is Magic and you can figure out the F uh which is my my friend learned in Navy uh radio school um but yeah that's that's the recolor uh ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 593, Start: 593, Overview: friend learned in Navy uh radio school um but yeah that's that's the recolor uh module um you'll see and I'm not quite ready to show it unfortunately but like just to kind of tease for the future um as we as we talked about or or should have briefly depict in the video down ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 604, Start: 604, Overview: um as we as we talked about or or should have briefly depict in the video down below uh we're working on in painting and out painting so being able to like modify a specific region or be able to you know change the aspect ratio of a photo lots of good stuff coming there a little ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 617, Start: 617, Overview: photo lots of good stuff coming there a little less cooked but again stay tuned um hopefully we'll have something pretty short order and then I mentioned um that we are reading all of the feature requests folks are posting and ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 627, Start: 627, Overview: um that we are reading all of the feature requests folks are posting and and taking those into account uh our my teammate Tracy isn't here today but she's doing like an incredible job going through these Super Active channels going through the uh Forum um you know Gus and and Aaron and other ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 640, Start: 640, Overview: going through the uh Forum um you know Gus and and Aaron and other other folks on the team are doing likewise and they're trying to roll it up in a way where our leadership could see oh yeah actually across surfaces these are the things people care most about and so I've never uh ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 652, Start: 652, Overview: these are the things people care most about and so I've never uh done this uh before and I'm going a little bit off script but I just want to want to show you um you know some of the things people are bringing up and this is not something you couldn't see yourself ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 662, Start: 662, Overview: are bringing up and this is not something you couldn't see yourself because if you go on the community Forum you can see like uh the things people have um filed and voted but we're just trying to look across you know Community Forum Discord slack internally you know ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 672, Start: 672, Overview: to look across you know Community Forum Discord slack internally you know there's tens of thousands of people working Adobe which still blows my mind and they also are very actively using the product and giving their feedback so we're just trying to kind of triangulate across those and then ultimately we make ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 684, Start: 684, Overview: we're just trying to kind of triangulate across those and then ultimately we make them into a record in jira which is our you know bug slash feature cracking system and we can kind of drag those around and say okay the most important thing uh let's hand that off to the designers you know they they can ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 694, Start: 694, Overview: thing uh let's hand that off to the designers you know they they can um visualize some solutions we run those by end and they say like well you're crazy or you miss this or what about that and then we just kind of iterate that and then it just moves through the process of of getting it stood up in ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 706, Start: 706, Overview: that and then it just moves through the process of of getting it stood up in code ultimately you know getting in front of you and then um shipping it so some of the top things that you'd imagine again are the ones that I think you'll you'll have seen so people are asking for the ability to save their ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 717, Start: 717, Overview: you'll you'll have seen so people are asking for the ability to save their history in some form and I'll give you a little kind of peek of what we're thinking about there um you know being able to upload a reference image and we can talk about I think how that might work ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 727, Start: 727, Overview: reference image and we can talk about I think how that might work um and I won't go through all of these because that's probably kind of tedious but but just to acknowledge like we we really are powered by you when it comes to ideas and requests right and it's just hopefully very virtuous Loop where ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 739, Start: 739, Overview: to ideas and requests right and it's just hopefully very virtuous Loop where you know we're taking in um the feedback where we're sort of triaging it we we take you know similar ideas and kind of dedupe them and try to put them all into a similar bucket and then based on that we can make the case ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 751, Start: 751, Overview: put them all into a similar bucket and then based on that we can make the case yet this is where we got to go first as I'm looking at this the numbers that we're seeing like the number of like essentially votes per category isn't exceptionally high and so it speaks to like the impact that ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 767, Start: 767, Overview: category isn't exceptionally high and so it speaks to like the impact that everybody like we have 240 people in the call right now for example like if you have an opinion on how Firefly should or shouldn't work or what you're concerned about or features you'd love to see like we're tracking them to a pretty granular ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 781, Start: 781, Overview: about or features you'd love to see like we're tracking them to a pretty granular level so you should definitely share it with us um because we'll see it and it'll probably be on the sheet that John just showed you so just want to really emphasize that yeah ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 793, Start: 793, Overview: showed you so just want to really emphasize that yeah yeah that that's a really good point your your vote does count and um you know just to to show it I'm sure we can drop the link in the chat or it's I'm sure pinned you know in various places on Discord but um ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 805, Start: 805, Overview: sure pinned you know in various places on Discord but um there's a little trade-off I mean Discord makes it's great because it's very immediate but then things kind of blow past and uh they can get lost and so what's nice with the community forum is um we can make posts that then stick ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 816, Start: 816, Overview: so what's nice with the community forum is um we can make posts that then stick around so we can pin things and um if there's something you like like this you know archive people have upvoted a lot right which is this you know flavor of what we're tracking is like history and uh again upload a reference image ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 828, Start: 828, Overview: what we're tracking is like history and uh again upload a reference image is another good one but relative to just the you know tens of thousands of folks you know on Discord uh you can tell like obviously only a smallish percentage go and register of votes but when you go and do that it does it does have a sort ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 843, Start: 843, Overview: and register of votes but when you go and do that it does it does have a sort of outsized impact yeah so yeah with that I just wanted to to jump over and again this is you'll you'll get a quick sense of like how sort of work in progress it is I just kind of think it's sometimes fun to see ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 856, Start: 856, Overview: sort of work in progress it is I just kind of think it's sometimes fun to see how the sausage is made sometimes it's super not fun to see how it's made um and you guys can like stay away from that um but yeah just to give you a sense of like how things evolve so uh let me ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 866, Start: 866, Overview: um but yeah just to give you a sense of like how things evolve so uh let me actually just pop a new tab and go to uh you know back back to the site because I just want to compare a couple things side by side sure and so uh obviously you know when you come to the site you can bring up the gallery ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 883, Start: 883, Overview: you know when you come to the site you can bring up the gallery and so you know I think the first thing people want when it comes to history is all right I just I did something cool I think it was like yesterday I don't know let me just go back and browse all the you know the top 20 50 ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 897, Start: 897, Overview: I don't know let me just go back and browse all the you know the top 20 50 whatever it was most recent things I did right and they disappear after a while it's kind of like an undue stack but you can always go back theoretically and be like yeah actually that was oh it was a steampunk golden doodle like how did I ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 907, Start: 907, Overview: like yeah actually that was oh it was a steampunk golden doodle like how did I get there right and then as we'll talk about um some of the the neat things you see in the community would be great if if they could kind of go more viral more quickly you know so for example our uh ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 917, Start: 917, Overview: they could kind of go more viral more quickly you know so for example our uh our colleague Lee brimelow um totally not a stage out but he's just like been making these adorable creatures I forget if I've shown these before um I don't think so you know and he's so ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 929, Start: 929, Overview: before um I don't think so you know and he's so we should mentioned that we're trying to put him on one of these Hangouts right maybe everyone can meet him yeah totally totally uh me you know me being the master planner that I am I I give him 40 minutes heads up but he's like ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 941, Start: 941, Overview: the master planner that I am I I give him 40 minutes heads up but he's like I'm sorry I'm at the vet uh but he would love to be here maybe next week we can have him have him come in so what's cool is when when you discover these like little corners of what they call the light in space right the sort of like ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 951, Start: 951, Overview: little corners of what they call the light in space right the sort of like you know the Mind Palace of uh what is Firefly um being able to like take that and then go oh cool like I want to share that with people and then they want to Riff on it ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 961, Start: 961, Overview: with people and then they want to Riff on it um you know how do we make that easier and faster and I think it's closely related to being able to save your stuff uh in fact Lee shared this out and I think it was here uh it might have been a different one he did but it was ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 972, Start: 972, Overview: I think it was here uh it might have been a different one he did but it was like you know such and such as a plush toy and then he went in and just like you know typed in different animals I've got a little golden doodle who's sleeping dutifully next to me and uh it's like we'll just swap out you know ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 982, Start: 982, Overview: sleeping dutifully next to me and uh it's like we'll just swap out you know camping put in gold and doodle and it makes you know durable cold Doodles so we would love a world where you know you could um share those and then you know if you make something really cool you can just ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 993, Start: 993, Overview: um share those and then you know if you make something really cool you can just click on it so essentially we've got something like that today in the inspiration feed that lives inside the app and actually that's how uh statistically the vast majority of image Creations get started you go in here and ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1003, Start: 1003, Overview: statistically the vast majority of image Creations get started you go in here and you're like oh I didn't even know I wanted that but that's pretty cool like let me go make this Lighthouse right and you hit try prompt well in the same way you know when you this is all just like a very you know sort of static hand ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1014, Start: 1014, Overview: you know when you this is all just like a very you know sort of static hand curated set of things to get the community going well now that we have a community right it would be great if uh people could more readily share those things and things could then you know Trend and four could do all kinds of ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1025, Start: 1025, Overview: things and things could then you know Trend and four could do all kinds of cool social stuff so back to the actual designs and they're very uh I just want to set expectations they're not meant to look pretty so much as it's just more conceptually like how would this go ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1035, Start: 1035, Overview: pretty so much as it's just more conceptually like how would this go so we'd have this notion of a collection which would be something we could add in the nav bar right so today you've got up at the top um you know there's home Gallery about FAQ well alongside Gallery you can have ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1046, Start: 1046, Overview: um you know there's home Gallery about FAQ well alongside Gallery you can have effectively your own Gallery right which is your private collection so none of this is shared obviously unless you choose to do that which would be very explicit and obvious uh and again sorry it's kind of tiny ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1057, Start: 1057, Overview: explicit and obvious uh and again sorry it's kind of tiny um I think it can make it bigger yeah there we go cool um so yeah just you know nothing super groundbreaking it's not supposed to be it's just like hey let me see the last N Things I did you know let's say it's 20. ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1069, Start: 1069, Overview: it's just like hey let me see the last N Things I did you know let's say it's 20. right and then uh favorites is very similar but uh you'd just be able to go and whenever you create something cool you can like hit a little heart button and be like oh yeah cool I wanna like I don't want that to age out right it's ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1083, Start: 1083, Overview: and be like oh yeah cool I wanna like I don't want that to age out right it's like just because I have 30 of these things I don't want to lose the last 20. you know if you only save the whereas like the sort of undo stack obviously that would get kind of overwhelming if we just kept going and going forever ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1093, Start: 1093, Overview: that would get kind of overwhelming if we just kept going and going forever right so think of they're very complimentary I'd probably say you know for the uh the recents actually what you want is like a four up view of each of these so you can see all the four variations and then Not only would we ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1105, Start: 1105, Overview: these so you can see all the four variations and then Not only would we save the bitmap but we'd also Save The Prompt and the seed and all the other stuff that one needs in order to recreate that so essentially yeah it really is like your own private uh version of the gallery right and then uh ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1115, Start: 1115, Overview: really is like your own private uh version of the gallery right and then uh as I'd say they'd love to be able to search within that to potentially depending on how much content yeah yeah totally yeah agreed I mean uh I think what will happen it'll be this like um this evolving thing where it's like ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1130, Start: 1130, Overview: what will happen it'll be this like um this evolving thing where it's like well once it exists then it's like well I'm gonna use it more and once I use it more then I want to split it into playlists or catalogs or Collections and you know it's like yes absolutely let's you know we'll do the first thing first ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1140, Start: 1140, Overview: you know it's like yes absolutely let's you know we'll do the first thing first and then if you like it we'll do the next thing and the next thing but yeah that would be a great problem to have is that people are using it so much they actually want some organization to it yeah for sure uh so just yeah at a you ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1151, Start: 1151, Overview: actually want some organization to it yeah for sure uh so just yeah at a you know a sort of like very very 1.0 simple starting place you know just give me a flat list um and then uh this is just some like treatments on like how it would look for mobile ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1163, Start: 1163, Overview: treatments on like how it would look for mobile um but sharing I think also could be a really natural extension of this right so when you see something really like you could uh hit a little um I guess uh tattooed guy with a man ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1174, Start: 1174, Overview: could uh hit a little um I guess uh tattooed guy with a man bun I don't know why some I don't know I don't even read the text sometimes I just assume it's Laura mipsum but I noticed man but for whatever reason so there you go I actually would like to see what that looks like ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1186, Start: 1186, Overview: there you go I actually would like to see what that looks like um but uh the idea is you could share this to a just a quick static link right so it wouldn't uh it wouldn't be dependent on somebody having access to Firefly or being logged in you know you could just like tweet out a link you ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1197, Start: 1197, Overview: Firefly or being logged in you know you could just like tweet out a link you could share it you could do whatever you want and the image wouldn't change it would just be the image you know that you shared but obviously the neat thing is if hey Lee goes and makes these amazing little creatures you know I want ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1207, Start: 1207, Overview: is if hey Lee goes and makes these amazing little creatures you know I want him to share those in such a way that I can then click this and like get the pizza guy right and then turn the pizza guy into steam steampunk pizza guy right then maybe I share that and it's like hey Lee did pizza guy John added ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1217, Start: 1217, Overview: then maybe I share that and it's like hey Lee did pizza guy John added steampunk right you get this kind of like cool chain of evidence or you know like genetics genetic mutation yeah yeah the what is it I kind of like the game of telephone a little bit like you know as you like take one phrase and ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1230, Start: 1230, Overview: the game of telephone a little bit like you know as you like take one phrase and you pass it along to people it sort of morphs into their own version of whatever they heard and I feel like you're kind of doing that with the visuals like you have a recipe and then you can rip off of it ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1239, Start: 1239, Overview: visuals like you have a recipe and then you can rip off of it yeah exactly and actually that's an incredibly apt segue so the number two request that I was listing uh folks might have noticed was um being able to upload a reference image and so that's really interesting ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1252, Start: 1252, Overview: um being able to upload a reference image and so that's really interesting one to unpack and this kind of gets at that telephone idea so I forget if I showed this last week I'm sure people have seen some of this already publicly but there's a technology called controlnet that you can add to these ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1263, Start: 1263, Overview: but there's a technology called controlnet that you can add to these generative networks um it's actually fun my old team at Google makes models for like face tracking and hand tracking they're adding control that's and they they let you just have basically more control ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1274, Start: 1274, Overview: adding control that's and they they let you just have basically more control over things right so if you have a pose like you could then use that pose to guide image synthesis um I was messing around with it uh just you know somebody had a stable diffusion based uh version on hugging face and I ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1285, Start: 1285, Overview: you know somebody had a stable diffusion based uh version on hugging face and I just took some artwork from you know stock and fed it in here and gave it some different prompts and literally with nothing but that image and some text I'm able to get all of these really ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1297, Start: 1297, Overview: nothing but that image and some text I'm able to get all of these really interesting variations the one that freaks me out frankly is the fact like it has this little You Know sketch of a light bulb and it's somehow like knows that's a light bulb and light bulbs glow and like they hit wood and it's I mean ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1309, Start: 1309, Overview: that's a light bulb and light bulbs glow and like they hit wood and it's I mean yeah this is the stuff that kind of creeps me out but in a good way um so my expectation what people mean by let me upload an image is like okay I want to you know structure what gets generated and so you know just having a ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1320, Start: 1320, Overview: want to you know structure what gets generated and so you know just having a simple affordance while you're creating to browse would would let you do that now I can't say anything to like ETA obviously there's like a lot of of refinements to make sure this is high quality the other thing you could do is ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1333, Start: 1333, Overview: refinements to make sure this is high quality the other thing you could do is upload an image for purposes of color and tone right so you can you can kind of think these like cool intersections in the recipe right it's like oh well Gus brought the meat and I brought the dry rub right and um now we're going to ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1345, Start: 1345, Overview: Gus brought the meat and I brought the dry rub right and um now we're going to combine those in a cool way um you know just uh I mentioned this my friend Dave he's the designer for character animator uh you know took this sketch and like turned it into these creatures ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1359, Start: 1359, Overview: sketch and like turned it into these creatures um I couldn't resist you know taking uh people remember Strong Bad shows my age but uh try tryg door the burninator and exactly we we park in the same garage yeah yeah um so so yeah you you can in fact uh upload trog door and then you ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1376, Start: 1376, Overview: yeah yeah um so so yeah you you can in fact uh upload trog door and then you can burn it uh all the villagers uh with this sort of thing so super mind-blowing yeah like literally by just picking an image as one of the ingredients that um that you could complement everything with you could get ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1390, Start: 1390, Overview: ingredients that um that you could complement everything with you could get to stuff like that and then that's to your point Gus about like um game of telephone there's a game uh called telestrations yeah which is super fun kids love it it's basically like Pictionary meets telephone yeah and each ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1402, Start: 1402, Overview: fun kids love it it's basically like Pictionary meets telephone yeah and each person gets a prompt you sketch it out you then show just the sketch of the next person they have to guess what you drew they do it then they pass it to the next person who has to draw what they guessed and by the end it gets bizarre ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1413, Start: 1413, Overview: next person who has to draw what they guessed and by the end it gets bizarre right and so here you can imagine well you know I upload an image I give it a prompt you know Gus sees it and he's like hey that's pretty cool but what if I put in a different image right and then shares that out and then you can ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1423, Start: 1423, Overview: I put in a different image right and then shares that out and then you can see this kind of like cool uh evolutionary path to to this outcome so again I can't promise any of this stuff or say when it would land but like these are some of the ideas like based on your feedback that we are considering I one ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1435, Start: 1435, Overview: are some of the ideas like based on your feedback that we are considering I one of the things I really love about what you shared today and really the feeling that it makes me feel and I think a lot of the people watching is this field for us like developing this technology and even though it's very early on it feels ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1447, Start: 1447, Overview: us like developing this technology and even though it's very early on it feels like fun again kind of like when you're a kid and you learn how to draw for the first time and you got all these ideas I think like this type of sharing and interaction unlocks some dormant areas at least in my brain where I'm like oh ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1460, Start: 1460, Overview: interaction unlocks some dormant areas at least in my brain where I'm like oh wait like the possibilities are literally endless and I just want to sit here all day and play with it which is just right I just think it's so cool and and really wonderful because we could all be like more creative and have more ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1473, Start: 1473, Overview: and really wonderful because we could all be like more creative and have more fun and then this is like a reason to do that yeah no exactly uh as I'm I'm fond of saying I mean I'll be honest I've been I don't know if you know between Adobe and Google 23 years ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 1657, Start: 1657, Overview: everyone will get to play with these tools it's going to be even better so that's my two cents on that you feel free to add in if you yeah no that yeah those are those exactly right in fact I'm gonna head into the office right after this because um some of the server team are in town ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1669, Start: 1669, Overview: right after this because um some of the server team are in town and we're having this big uh meeting of the minds about um architecture and like how to make it scale efficiently and make sure we don't you know bankrupt the company and get fired uh because you know if the cloud ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1680, Start: 1680, Overview: you know bankrupt the company and get fired uh because you know if the cloud gpus ain't cheap um but yeah really it's literally just like we're launching and learning as as we go and um you know we're adding tens of thousands of people every day which sounds like a big number until you see ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1692, Start: 1692, Overview: of thousands of people every day which sounds like a big number until you see the backlog and then you're like that's an even bigger number um so yeah thanks for your patience um sorry that it's not as quick as we'd want it's not from any desire on our part it's literally just like ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1702, Start: 1702, Overview: want it's not from any desire on our part it's literally just like you know how fast can the knob get get turned yep um we've had a lot of questions about around leg is it going to be part of Photoshop can I generate objects as separate layers there was one question ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1713, Start: 1713, Overview: Photoshop can I generate objects as separate layers there was one question around like how long did it take to go from beta or from pre to where we currently are to Beta um and so I know these are all over the board but maybe first we can handle uh kind of the integration the future idea ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1727, Start: 1727, Overview: board but maybe first we can handle uh kind of the integration the future idea my general stance is like we said earlier please keep giving us feedback on what you want to see um it's really important so if you see this Tech or you're seeing a demo or maybe you get access to the beta and you're like hey ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 1783, Start: 1783, Overview: um you know Adobe Express is another great service where um that team actually did this this really early exploration with how do you make um text objects that have generative properties and then you know when when should you update those I think that ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1795, Start: 1795, Overview: properties and then you know when when should you update those I think that General pattern is really cool where you know you can imagine almost in any surface you know having an object and then just attaching parameters which are generative right so like today in Photoshop you make an object in ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1807, Start: 1807, Overview: generative right so like today in Photoshop you make an object in attention a drop shadow or you do the same thing in illustrator it's like well conceptually there's not a lot that separates a drop shadow from uh you know a set of instructions particularly if you have these like image conditioned uh ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1817, Start: 1817, Overview: a set of instructions particularly if you have these like image conditioned uh things now again I'm kind of getting over for my skis here because I don't want to over promise anything but like as a it's just a set of building blocks to me that makes a lot of sense obviously there's a lot of work to make ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1827, Start: 1827, Overview: to me that makes a lot of sense obviously there's a lot of work to make sure it actually works well you know that would be performant you'd have to figure out like how often should it update you know do you actually if you move something around do you want it to update every time you do that or does ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1837, Start: 1837, Overview: move something around do you want it to update every time you do that or does that get slow and annoying right so there's a lot of like really interesting ux questions I think at a starting place I'd look at you know kind of what the team's previewed at Max which was just those like you know very ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1847, Start: 1847, Overview: team's previewed at Max which was just those like you know very very immediately uh self-evidently useful Integrations cool thank you I know I appreciate you dancing around delicate topics always but I think you know consensus is and I kind of like this this session has ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1861, Start: 1861, Overview: but I think you know consensus is and I kind of like this this session has started to become and even last week has become let's put John on the hot seat and see how much information we can squeeze out of them so oh yeah it's all fun and games until people like wait what did you say and this was recorded ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1875, Start: 1875, Overview: fun and games until people like wait what did you say and this was recorded but no obviously I I don't think I'm disclosing anything uh like that you couldn't see by just looking at like the upvoted list right I just wanted to acknowledge we are super super engaged listening even if we don't always reply ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1885, Start: 1885, Overview: acknowledge we are super super engaged listening even if we don't always reply and folks are taking those data points putting them into a list which we prioritize and then design and build against right so as Gus said um the more the more specific you can be uh the more detailed you know the better ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1898, Start: 1898, Overview: um the more the more specific you can be uh the more detailed you know the better we can understand what you're trying to do and then uh and then help teams like integrate accordingly thanks John um we have one more pretty basic question but maybe we can do it very ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1909, Start: 1909, Overview: um we have one more pretty basic question but maybe we can do it very quick I know we're a little over but if you're okay navigating back to the Firefly duel there was a question about the wave icon in the top right corner of the image I thought maybe we could just again show people quickly yes the wave ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1919, Start: 1919, Overview: the image I thought maybe we could just again show people quickly yes the wave icon and also maybe the reference image feature and kind of maybe show people how totally yes thank you that's great um we were adding features just again sort of candidly so so quickly as we ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1933, Start: 1933, Overview: um we were adding features just again sort of candidly so so quickly as we were like hey what day do we ship and then it's like it's like there's one more thing we could sneak in so not everything is like super discoverable right now uh which is okay um but but to to guess this point people ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1945, Start: 1945, Overview: right now uh which is okay um but but to to guess this point people are starting to notice like yeah what is that little like double tilde thing so that's uh show similar so if you like oh I really like this lower lower right guy give me three variants essentially on that uh you can do it so I just click ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1958, Start: 1958, Overview: give me three variants essentially on that uh you can do it so I just click that and you know they should all be kind of similar um and it's running a little slow this is our internal build so again one of the reasons we don't scale faster is we want ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1970, Start: 1970, Overview: our internal build so again one of the reasons we don't scale faster is we want to make sure that performance doesn't start to suck for everybody just because we added too many people too fast um but yeah these are these are ones that are kind of like all right anchor around ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1979, Start: 1979, Overview: but yeah these are these are ones that are kind of like all right anchor around this image and go from there so that's that's pretty straightforward the one which is like a little weirder in a sense in this just because it's like a more unique previously unseen feature is uh ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1988, Start: 1988, Overview: more unique previously unseen feature is uh and again it's probably small on your screen but that's used as a reference image so you can invoke this from the three dot menu and if I use this as a reference image then essentially think I'm going to pin down uh on this guy and ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 1998, Start: 1998, Overview: reference image then essentially think I'm going to pin down uh on this guy and then so it says fairy house in the woods and you see this little thumbnail preview of The Anchor well then if you said you know fairy house let me say on the beach let's just see what happens uh so now it's going to make four new ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2011, Start: 2011, Overview: the beach let's just see what happens uh so now it's going to make four new images but it's taking that first image as one of the inputs so this is you know if you're like well doesn't that sound like that control not thing you were talking about it's like aha it is kind of in that vein right it is it is using ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2024, Start: 2024, Overview: talking about it's like aha it is kind of in that vein right it is it is using one bitmap to generate or to affect the um the production of other bitmaps what's then kind of cool is if you click on this um it is Easter so give you Easter eggs right it's a little bit subtle I ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2037, Start: 2037, Overview: um it is Easter so give you Easter eggs right it's a little bit subtle I acknowledge um but you can vary the strength between the original image and the um uh The Prompt so if I crank it up more towards the new prompt so it's basically more on the beach than in the woods now you've ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2049, Start: 2049, Overview: the new prompt so it's basically more on the beach than in the woods now you've got this um so you started here you've got something which is like kind of structurally similar but now we've like changed the context which I think is super wild and again with all this stuff ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2060, Start: 2060, Overview: changed the context which I think is super wild and again with all this stuff um you know please try it out it's early it's like semi-hidden we know but getting some feedback would be great and then as we kind of beef up the tech stack and make it the UI easier to use uh that can be based on what you have ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2073, Start: 2073, Overview: stack and make it the UI easier to use uh that can be based on what you have found everybody is really excited to see these features um thanks for running through them one more time with us John we actually have a suggestion from Chris on a feature they'd like to see um and ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",

      "Id: 2097, Start: 2097, Overview: track it and other people can upvote it but um Chris says um I really love how quickly you can iterate in Firefly however so much gets lost I know you can press the back arrow but it would be really cool to have a sort of canvas timeline where you could just scroll ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2108, Start: 2108, Overview: really cool to have a sort of canvas timeline where you could just scroll back up to a previous state yeah absolutely agreed um I'm always amazed that it works at all it's kind of like that old joke about a dog walking on its hind legs you know like that's not good but like it's ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
      "Id: 2119, Start: 2119, Overview: about a dog walking on its hind legs you know like that's not good but like it's cool that it's happening uh so the fact that the team has been able to make it work where you can kind of toggle back and forth with you know front back arrows is is pretty cool um but yeah that's that's a first step ,url:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tWSvfa8j0\n",
